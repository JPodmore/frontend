He has been the ultimate romantic hero for about 200 years.</p> <p><strong>Rich, handsome and clever, but only secretly nice: it’s the same formula that created Mr Rochester, Count Dracula, Rhett Butler and </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/fifty-shades-of-grey\" title=\"\"><strong>Christian Grey</strong></a><strong>. At root they’re antifeminist archetypes because they feed women a rationale for tolerating attractive men’s bad behaviour. </strong>Why, yes, I would love to hear the rest of your undergraduate dissertation at some later date. But first I have some shocking news to tell you.</p> <p><strong>Don’t tell me Darcy was gay? All those “visits to London” with Mr Bingley. I should have known! </strong>Nope. This is about his famous “£10,000 a year”.</p> <p><strong>Tax avoidance? </strong>Worse. According to the novelist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/joanna-trollope\" title=\"\">Joanna Trollope</a>, who has been writing an updated version of Pride and Prejudice, both Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley most likely got their money, at least indirectly, from exploitation, including slavery.</p> <p><strong>Oh, that isn’t very romantic. </strong>No, indeed. “Why does Mr Bingley in Pride and Prejudice have all this leisure to sort of drift between Netherfield and London?” <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2989062/Did-Mr-Darcy-make-fortune-slave-trade-Romantic-hero-profited-misery-says-author-modernised-Jane-Austen-s-classic-work.html\" title=\"\">Trollope asked the audience at the Dubai Festival of Literature on Saturday</a>. “He is a young man with means because of the slave trade … What built Pemberley?”</p> <p><strong>Darcy’s country seat? </strong>Well remembered, yes. “Pemberley was built, one imagines,” Trollope continues, “on proceeds of the coal mines in Derbyshire. What was the life of an 18th-century miner like? Not much fun.”</p> <p><strong>OK, fair enough. But come on, I mean who didn’t make money from slavery back then? </strong>The slaves?</p> <p><strong>All right, apart from them? </strong>Actually, that’s Trollope’s point. The early 19th century was not picturesque and quaint in the way that people envisage Pride and Prejudice. It had a “very dark underbelly”.</p> <p><strong>And underbellies are never attractive. </strong>Not even in a frilly shirt.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“In his defence, it’s worth pointing out that Mr Darcy is a fictional character.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Although that does make all his angsty, handsome letter-writing fictional as well.”</p>","headline":"Did Mr Darcy make his

Everyone called Gary. The Human Garynome, if you will.</p> <p><strong>I won’t. But I get the picture. What’s happening to them? Is there a new deadly virus that only attacks Garys? </strong>Thankfully, no. But at the end of the day, the Gary is only human, and not enough new Garys are being created to replace the ones who die.</p> <p><strong>Why not? </strong>Parents just don’t like the name any more. Gary reached its peak in the US in the early 1950s, when it was at one time the 12th most popular boy’s name, with more than 38,000 appearing every year. There were even 90 girls named Gary in 1947.</p> <p><strong>Many of them no doubt in homage to Gary Cooper. </strong>Ah yes, one of the all-time great Garys, (though he was actually born a Frank). In England and Wales, the peak came later, in 1964, when Gary was 16th on the list.</p> <p><strong>And what’s the situation now? </strong>Desperate. Gary has plummeted from view on both sides of the Atlantic, and is now severely endangered. <a href=\"http://www.ourbabynamer.com/Gary-name-popularity.html\" draggable=\"true\">Just 450 were created in the US in 2013</a>, and <a href=\"http://names.darkgreener.com/#gary\" draggable=\"true\">28 in England and Wales.</a> Numbers will be swollen slightly by some of the more relaxed Gareths and Garths, but they too are endangered species. On current trends there may be no new Garys within a decade or two, and none left alive by the beginning of the 22nd century.</p> <p><strong>Habitat loss. Is that what we’re talking about? </strong>In a way. There are still some very well-known Garys of course, such as Lineker, Oldman, Barlow and Kemp.</p> <p><strong>Although that is basically a list of men who had their heyday in the 1980s and 1990s. </strong>Exactly. Overexposure around that time has harmed many great names. In 2013, English and Welsh parents created just 17 Roys, <a href=\"http://names.darkgreener.com/#keith\" draggable=\"true\">15 Keiths</a>, seven Kevins and <a href=\"http://names.darkgreener.com/#tracey\" draggable=\"true\">three Traceys</a>.</p> <p><strong>Three! </strong>I’m afraid so. Compare that with <a href=\"http://names.darkgreener.com/#jaxson\">110 Jaxsons</a>, 167 Romeos, <a href=\"http://names.darkgreener.com/#sienna\">2,211 Siennas</a>, <a href=\"http://names.darkgreener.com/#leo\">3,264 Leos</a> and 4,511 Oscars.</p> <p><strong>So we’ve basically become nations of losers. I blame the cocktail umbrella!</strong> I thought you might.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Is it time to establish a small breeding population of Garys in London zoo?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “That would be cruel. Garys must be left free to roam in the wild.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 10 March 2015. The figures for name frequency in England and Wales were originally referred to as UK-wide data. This has now been corrected.</p>","headline":"High noon for Gary: why is the once-popular name on the verge of extinction?","trailText":"The name is dying out, and not even Garys Cooper or Lineker seem capable of saving it.

The ISS – the International Space Station.</p> <p><strong>How is she going to get there? </strong>She’s going to fly there on a rocket.</p> <p><strong>This is the </strong><a href=\"http://\"><strong>Sarah Brightman</strong></a><strong> who sang </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2Tkx6BgRFE\"><strong>I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper</strong></a><strong>? </strong>The same – she may even get the chance to sing it in space.</p> <p><strong>Is this an idea for a musical? Because I hate it. </strong>No, this is happening. Sarah Brightman is becoming an astronaut.</p> <p><strong>Don’t astronauts have to undergo, like, training? </strong>She has done the training, or most of it. If all goes according to plan, she will blast off with two cosmonauts on a Soyuz rocket in September.</p> <p><strong>Really. </strong>Yes, really. Then she’ll spend a week aboard the ISS, where she’s to give a concert before returning to Earth.</p> <p><strong>Who thought this was a good plan? </strong>Sarah Brightman did. She’s paying with her own money.</p> <p><strong>She’s got enough money to go into space? </strong>She’s certainly rich – although estimates of her net worth are pretty similar to estimates of the cost of sending her up – about £35m.</p> <p><strong>I can think of lots of better ways to spend that sort of dosh. </strong>You’re not the first person to consider space tourism a scandalous waste of money.</p> <p><strong>Too right. I’d use it to build a solid chocolate mansion. </strong>Wouldn’t it melt?</p> <p><strong>For £35m, it had better not. </strong>On the other hand, one could argue that space tourism provides a way to fund flights to and from the ISS.</p> <p><strong>Will we be allowed to vote her off? </strong>I don’t think you quite get how this works.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“This voyage is a product of a dream … finally it can be a reality.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“I’m sorry Ms Brightman, but if your carry-on bag doesn’t fit in the cage, we have to charge you an extra £7m.”</p>  <figure

The US mostly uses K-Cups, produced by Keurig Green Mountain, which grew out of <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2011/08/07/the_inside_story_of_keurigs_rise_to_a_billion_dollar_coffee_empire/\">the company that was founded on Sylvan’s invention in 1990</a>. Snooty Europeans have Nespresso, which is a bit older.</p> <p><strong>Are other brands of coffee pod also available?</strong> They are. Indeed the whole market is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/feb/24/keurig-2-0-hack-cups-company-freedom-clip\">growing like crazy</a>. Keurig Green Mountain had revenue of $4.7bn last year – a fivefold increase on 2010. <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304626304579507060960147686\">Nespresso took about the same in 2013</a>.</p> <p><strong>Who’d have thought you could make money feeding people’s addiction ultra-conveniently? </strong>John Sylvan. “It’s like a cigarette for coffee,” he <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/03/the-abominable-k-cup-coffee-pod-environment-problem/386501/\">told the Atlantic magazine on Monday</a>.</p> <p><strong>Ah, yes. </strong>Except now he’s racked with regret about the whole thing. “I feel bad sometimes that I ever did it,” he said. These days, no longer part of the company, he doesn’t even own a Keurig machine. “They’re kind of expensive to use ... plus it’s not like drip coffee is tough to make.”</p> <p><strong>Why would he feel bad though? </strong>Because K-Cups generate vast amounts of plastic waste that does not biodegrade and cannot be recycled, and this is bad for the environment.</p> <p><strong>Bloody environment, spoiling everybody’s fun. </strong>It needn’t though. For instance, since 2006, Keurig has been making some different kinds of K-Cups that are 100% recyclable. <a href=\"http://www.nestle-nespresso.com/sustainability/sustainability/capsules\">As are Nespresso’s aluminium pods</a>.

It suggests there’s something wrong with being camp because he’s glad he isn’t.</p> <p><strong>It only just suggests it. </strong>You forget that this is a highly politicised area in the gay world.</p> <p><strong>You forget that some people enjoy being angry.</strong> Maybe. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/mar/03/russell-tovey-sorry-effeminate-actor-drama-school\">Anyway Tovey has apologised now</a>. “I surrender. You got me. I’m sat baffled and saddened that a misfired inarticulate quote of mine has branded me worst gay ever,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/russelltovey\">he said on Twitter</a>. “I’m proud to be who I am and proud for others. We’re in this together, I want you to know whatever you think I meant, I didn’t.”</p> <p><strong>That’s a logical paradox. </strong>It’s also not really apologising.</p> <p><strong>I’d say that’s appropriate if you’ve not really done anything wrong. </strong>Yes, you would.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I’m here! I’m butch! Get used to it!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “I’m proud to be who I am, although obviously I’d be just as proud if I were somebody else, like you for instance, which admittedly invalidates pride as a concept.”</p>","headline":"Russell Tovey: he may be proud but is the ‘worst gay ever’ actually sorry?","trailText":"The actor is having to backtrack after comments about effeminate men, but

What is </strong><a href=\"http://storyful.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Storyful</strong></a><strong>? A literacy charity? A movement to bring back public libraries? A children’s literature museum opening soon, ideally near me? </strong>Alas, no. It’s a company that combines digital media and global journalism. No, wait – digital journalism and global media. No, wait – social media and global digital journalism. No – global social media and medium digital globes. No, wait – I think I was right the first time.</p> <p><strong>None of that has helped me. What does it do? </strong>It discovers, verifies and acquires the most valuable content on the social web so that its partners can own breaking news stories with speed and accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Did you get that off Storyful’s own website? </strong>I did, yes.</p> <p><strong>Do you know what it means? </strong>I think it means its global team of journalists source, date and geolocate every piece of content they deliver, and provide direct access to the source.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/25/phonr-hacking-trial-legal-costs-rebekah-brooks\">Phone-hacking trial: total legal costs approach £100m</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Stop quoting the website and tell me what it actually does. </strong>I think it sifts through all the shite out there and decides what’s slightly less shite and might form the basis of a news report, or possibly what’s totally shite but also total clickbait and might still bring in advertising money/increase traffic/raise your profile as required.</p> <p><strong>Why’s it in the news? </strong>The former chief executive of News International and woman who was acquitted of all charges arising from her years there during which corrupt practices and criminal activities were endemic at the newspaper under her charge, Rebekah Brooks, is about to work there.</p> <p><strong>Why? </strong>Because her former boss/Svengali/ministering angel Rupert Murdoch bought it a few years ago from founder Mark Little and she’s still kicking her innocent heels after the aforementioned phone hacking scandal.</p> <p><strong>I see. It’s a match made in hell. </strong>It’ll probably be in Dublin, actually, as that’s where Storyful is quartered.</p> <p><strong>Ah, Dublin – fair city, where the girls are so pretty, and where endemic, systemic financial and political corruption polluting an entire generation is barely to be found.

I read it in Horrible Histories. </strong>Wrong, they reckon.</p> <p><strong>Who reckons? </strong>Scientists in Oslo who have just published a study in <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/02/20/1412887112\" title=\"\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a> purporting to show that while there is no historical correlation between good breeding conditions for rats and the occurrences of plague in the Middle East and Europe, there is between the kind of weather that makes for frisky giant gerbils and millions of bubo-strewn patients all along the Silk Road routes travelled shortly thereafter.</p> <p><strong>Not my darling Nibbles! He’s no harbinger of doom! Wait – did you say giant gerbils? </strong>Yes, Rhombomys opimus, the great gerbil, found throughout the arid, sandy landscapes of central Asia and a known carrier of the plague pathogen Yersinia pestis.</p> <p><strong>And how great are these great gerbils? </strong>Not great at all for us – did you not hear what I just said about the plague pathogen Yersinia pestis?</p> <p><strong>No, I mean, how big are they? </strong>Oh. Up to 8in – or double that if you include the tail.</p> <p><strong>Wow. What was attractive at one size becomes not at all at another. </strong>I know. Like penises.</p> <p><strong>Mmm. So, are we all safe? As long as one’s charming childhood and/or classroom pet doesn’t look like something from a James Herbert novel? </strong>Yes. Nibbles remains a Meriones unguiculatus; the greatest threat is him escaping and gnawing through every electrical wire in the house.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Time for your exercise wheel, little one!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Could I have a packet of sunflower seeds and some aspirin? I’m not feeling so hot.”</p>","headline":"You dirty rat!

Leader of the Protestant Reformation, and scourge of popes? </strong>That’s him: neat brown bob, sweet little floppy hat, hands like C-clamps.</p> <p><strong>I’m having difficulty reconciling your description with the cantankerous theologian of history. In particular, the hands. </strong>That’s probably because I’m talking about Martin Luther the plastic Playmobil figurine.</p> <p><strong>Oh, I see. Wait, what? </strong>German toy manufacturer Playmobil has just issued a special miniature Martin Luther, holding an outsize quill pen and a German-language Bible.</p> <p><strong>Is there much call for that sort of thing? </strong>The first run of 34,000 sold out in less than 72 hours. It’s the company’s fastest-selling figurine ever.</p> <p><strong>I’ll confess I’m stunned. </strong>So was Playmobil – a company spokesperson called it “a big mystery [and] a huge surprise”. Now a second batch is being rushed into production.</p> <p><strong>Is there any precedent for this? </strong>Not really, though the Playmobil figurine of Renaissance painter Albrecht Dürer sold 80,000 units over three years.</p> <p><strong>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again – German kids are really weird. </strong>It’s probably more to do with the parents: the 500th anniversary of the Reformation is looming in 2017. “Parents want to make sure their children grow up knowing who he is,” says Astrid Mühlman, director of the government office in charge of the quinquennial commemorations, “because he had such an impact on how society evolved in Europe.”</p> <p><strong>Did he? </strong>Yes. His German Bible was a blueprint for other vernacular translations. He challenged church authority, heavily influenced Christian thought and practice, and even wrote the hymn A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.</p> <p><strong>Not bad for a tiny, round-headed, cylindrical-bodied fellow. </strong>Indeed.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“I need to nail these 95 Theses to that church door over there. Would you mind removing the quill pen from my right hand, and snapping in the hammer?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“And then could you snap the quill pen back in? I have an antisemitic tract to finish.”</p>","headline":"Why Martin Luther is the answer to Playmobil’s prayers","trailText":"More than 34,000 figures of the German Protestant Reformer have been sold
