to a $132.5m worldwide debut</a>.</p> <p>The $70.1m estimated haul for Kenneth Branagh’s film was one of the best ever openings for the month of March, and just ahead of Maleficent’s $69.4m debut in June last year. Disney’s riff on Sleeping Beauty starred Angelina Jolie in the title role and went on to make $758.4m globally to be one of the top 10 movies of 2014 at the box office.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/13/cinderella-review-kenneth-branaghs-perky-pretty-cupcake-of-a-fairytale\">Cinderella review – Kenneth Branagh's perky, pretty cupcake of a fairytale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cinderella features a largely British cast transferred from the small screen. Downton Abbey’s Lily James takes the role of the downtrodden servant girl, with Game of Thrones’ Richard Madden as Prince Charming. Australian Oscar-winner Cate Blanchett is Cinders’ wicked stepmother, with Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother in a traditionalist take which has drawn strong reviews. </p> <p>Analysts suggested the film had benefited in the US from an audience skewed towards female cinemagoers, families and under 12s. Screenings also gave Disney fans the chance to see Frozen short Frozen Fever on the big screen for the first time, a significant bonus given the animated musical is the fifth highest-grossing movie of all time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/mar/12/run-all-night-video-review\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/46tvv\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2256984\"                data-video-name=\"Run All Night - video review\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/3/12/1426172858190/crop_KP_119191_640x360.jpeg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-455870913\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/3/12/1426172854963/crop_KP_119191_1200x720.jpeg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/03/12/150312runallnight_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/03/12/150312runallnight.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/03/12/150312runallnight_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/03/12/150312runallnight_small.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/03/12/150312runallnight_large.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>There was less positive news for the only other new film to make the North American top 10, Liam Neeson action thriller Run All Night, which opened in second spot with a relatively weak $11m bow. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, the movie stars the Ballymena-born actor as a hitman forced to defend his estranged son (Joel Kinnaman) from a vengeful crime boss. Neeson’s Taken 3 scored a $39.2m opening just two months ago, but the middling turnout for his latest gun-toting role suggests appetites may finally be waning for the Irish actor’s belated reconfiguring as an action star, despite reasonable reviews.</p> <p>Third place in North America went to Matthew Vaughn spy caper Kingsman, with another $6.2m in its fifth week for a total of $107.3m. The top five was rounded out by Will Smith heist romance Focus, with another $5.81m in its fifth week for a total of $44m, and last week’s No 1 Chappie, with $5.8m in its second week for a total of $23.3m.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Disney’s Marvel Comics riff Big Hero Six became the highest grossing worldwide animated release of 2014. The film has now taken $632m worldwide.<br /></p> <h2>US box office top 10, 13-15 March</h2> <p>1. <a

known for Boardwalk Empire, American Hustle and more, has seen his Hollywood cachet grow further with the the news that he’ll take the lead in the upcoming remake of gothic adventure The Crow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/dec/01/jack-huston-on-my-radar\">On my radar: Jack Huston's cultural highlights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The original, based on James O’Barr’s comic book, concerns a man who is brought back to life and sets about avenging the death of his fiancee, guided by a telepathic link with a crow. It topped the box office chart in the US when it was released in 1994, and was made all the more poignant by the death of its lead, Bruce Lee’s son Brandon, who was killed when a gun on set was mistakenly filled with live ammunition.</p> <p>Huston has been rumoured for the role in the remake from director Corin Hardy, but <a href=\"http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/93326/exclusive-jack-huston-confirmed-as-the-crow/\">an interview by Dread Central</a> with O’Barr at a comic convention suggests that it’s a done deal. “Jack Huston has definitely been cast,” O’Barr was reported as saying, and that he was “really happy with that choice.”</p> <p>It’s another eye-catching lead for an actor who has been steadily making his name with acclaimed supporting roles. He gave mobster drama Boardwalk Empire one of its most vivid characters as disfigured war veteran Richard Harrow; played Jack Kerouac in Kill Your Darlings; and rounded out the all-star ensemble in American Hustle. He’s since been cast as Mr Wickham in Austen slash-fic adaptation Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and in his biggest role yet, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/17/jack-huston-morgan-freeman-ben-hur\">he will play Ben-Hur</a> in the remake of the swords-and-sandals epic which is currently filming.</p> <p>It’s a step up for director Hardy too, whose debut feature The Hallow – an Ireland-set horror – was sold at Sundance this year. He previously made music videos for the likes of Keane, Rizzle Kicks, The Prodigy and John Newman.</p>","headline":"Bird man: Jack Huston to take lead in The Crow remake","trailText":"The actor, known for roles in Boardwalk Empire, American Hustle and the upcoming Ben-Hur remake is to play the comic-book gothic avenger","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/16/1426495666381/a77cbb47-c412-4739-8a0a-2cd14ff006cf-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"308","commentable":"true","byline":"Ben Beaumont-Thomas","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-03-19T09:30:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/16/jack-huston-the-crow-remake","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/mar/16/jack-huston-the-crow-remake","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/actionandadventure","webTitle":"Action and adventure","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/actionandadventure","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/actionandadventure","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/comics","webTitle":"Comics and graphic novels","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/comics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/comics","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ben-beaumont-thomas","webTitle":"Ben Beaumont-Thomas","r2ContributorId":"31786","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/20/1424452686624/Ben-Beaumont-Thomas.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/20/1424452707314/Ben-Beaumont-Thomas-L.png","firstName":"ben","lastName":"beaumont-thomas","twitterHandle":"ben_bt","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Beaumont-Thomas is Assistant Commissioning Editor for the Guardian's culture section.</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-beaumont-thomas","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/ben-beaumont-thomas","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"8ca09d69d8d4d0a9050f0bcf8d5a56e6a4dd6a2a","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/16/1426495664701/a77cbb47-c412-4739-8a0a-2cd14ff006cf-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"copyright":"Getty Images","displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/16/1426495664701/a77cbb47-c412-4739-8a0a-2cd14ff006cf-220x132.jpeg","source":"Getty Images","photographer":"Ernesto Ruscio","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Jack Huston","suppliersReference":"466443502","height":"132","credit":"Photograph: Ernesto Ruscio/Getty Images","caption":"Flying high...

man?","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-16T09:00:09Z","sectionId":"film","id":"film/2015/mar/16/the-voices-ryan-reynolds-john-patterson","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/46h4m","standfirst":"<p>Reynolds knocks one out of the park in this kitschy comic horror, but marquee-topping stardom still seems to elude him<br></p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>I’ve been a big fan of Ryan Reynolds since Van Wilder: Party Liaison in 2002, when he played a role not unlike Otter, Tim Matheson’s suavely degenerate Big Man On Campus in Animal House (the link was intentional: Matheson played Van’s dad). I’ve enjoyed him, if not his work, intermittently ever since. I like his blandly cheesy mall-rat good looks, which can be wimped down for comedy or buffed up for action, and his willingness to be serious and very silly. And now he has given us what may be the performance of his career, as a kindly serial killer in the bracingly dark and violent black comedy <strong>The Voices </strong>– and over here in the US the thing gets a simultaneous VOD and limited theatrical release.<br /></p> <p>This seems typical, somehow, of a career that never quite seems to coalesce into coherence or acclaim. Reynolds made his bones in comedy, often of the proudly lowbrow variety, and has kept one foot in the genre ever since: Van Wilder, Smokin’ Aces, The Change-Up and The Proposal, alongside Sandra Bullock, who has good taste in offshore leading men (Reynolds is Canadian in all the best ways), plus cameos in the Harold and Kumar franchise and Seth McFarlane’s movies. Parallel to all that, there have been repeated attempts to sell the ripped-abs version of Reynolds as an action hero. First there was Blade: Trinity, then X-Men Origins: Wolverine, then the Green Lantern and, more recently, the train-wreck action comedy hybrid R.I.P.D., which bombed spectacularly and racked up a chastening 13% average at Rotten Tomatoes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IaPaB4Pzqk\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5IaPaB4Pzqk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>But here and there, as in Safe House and Buried, Reynolds knocks one out of the park. The Voices seems like a calling card movie to remind casting directors of his range and depth as a performer; its combination of kitschy sweetness and bottomless horror and violence aiming to jolt us out of any easy understanding of his abilities. And it’s effective: as a sweet loser toiling in a candy-coloured bathtub factory, he’s an inoffensive nobody; at home, as a severely mentally ill man off his medication. He’s got severed heads in the fridge, murder on his mind and a dog and a cat who behave like the angel and devil on Tom Hulce’s shoulders in Animal House, urging him on to ever greater feats of bloodletting. That a movie so tonally all over the place manages to hold itself together and keep the audience in its grasp is a testament to director Marjane Satrapi (Persepolis), who’s working here in a completely different register from that of her earlier work.</p> <p>It’s difficult to watch Reynolds’s career not come together. He has all the accoutrements of stardom – name recognition, marriages to noted beauties – everything except actual, marquee-topping success. He has turned into the male Jessica Biel: his every failed relaunch, like hers, is reminiscent of watching endless footage of 1960s Nasa rocket crashes. Would someone please do right by this man? </p>","headline":"The Voices: is Ryan Reynolds destined to be Hollywood's nearly man?","trailText":"Reynolds knocks one out of the park in this kitschy comic

the ads and the albums, Jennifer Lopez has found time to star in this trashy thriller. She needn’t have bothered<br></p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Jennifer Lopez is busy these days: another season on American Idol, a spell shilling for good old Vichy-scented L’Oréal, another album last year, another tour, a memoir called True Love, and now the capper, <strong>The Boy Next Door</strong>. While the musical side of her career is undoubtedly flourishing, the movie side – to put it mildly – is suffering from malign neglect.</p> <p>Exhibit A: The Boy Next Door, shot in 23 days for next to nothing – and boy, does it show. “We put all $4m in front of the camera!” exulted the star recently, inadvertently highlighting the movie’s myriad shortcomings behind it. For instance, a screenwriter who thinks there’s such a thing as “a first edition of the Iliad”, not to mention the director or the 100 people on set who might have spotted that howler before it went globally viral a month ago, having evidently drawn no comment during postproduction, either. I will admit some grudging admiration, however, for any movie featuring the line: “Dude, you gotta read the Iliad!”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgbBwovOOoc\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MgbBwovOOoc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>The speaker of that line, the eponymous neighbour-hunk Noah (Ryan Guzman), falls hard for trial-separated mother J-Lo. She’s also his teacher, which is interesting because, although the screenplay never bothers to tell us why, he’s 20 years old and still in high school. They end up in bed after a ton of early-warning justifications in the script for a teacher sleeping with her hunky student: she’s feeling vulnerable; she had a bad date earlier; her philandering husband (John Corbett) is bugging her; she’s had a couple of drinks; and <em>God damn</em>, would you just look at those abs! Plus he tells her: “A woman like you should be cherished, Claire...”</p> <p>Big mistake. She tries to end it. The kid doesn’t like rejection (“I love your mom’s cookies!” he tells her son at one particularly toothsome moment). It turns out he has a violent streak and a dodgy past back in San Bernardino – a city that Hollywood routinely slanders as an inland white-trash hellhole – and thenceforth he’s stalking and harassing J-Lo, eyeing the brakes on Corbett’s midlife crisis-mobile (portending a thrill-free runaway car sequence later), pouring poison in her son’s ear then boinking his prom date, and so on. Each escalation is less plausible than the last, and the climactic fight is a letdown.</p> <p>All the signs were there: a powerful star, a malleable director, a newcomer-hunk, a dim-wattage male co-star (Corbett is so ultra-safe it’s like he’s been spayed). It’s all very insecure, late-50s Joan Crawford stuff. And everything in it can be found in a far better realised, albeit no less trashy thriller that J-Lo made in 2002 with Michael Apted, in which she flees cross-country from a monstrously violent husband, played to the absolute nines by Billy Campbell.</p> <p>That movie was called Enough. The Boy Next Door is its exact opposite: Not Nearly Enough.</p>","headline":"The Boy Next Door: J-Lo stars in the mother of all misfires","trailText":"Between the ads and the albums, Jennifer Lopez has found time to star in this trashy thriller.

Our mutual love of film brings out the real me: a chubby teenager with a highlighter, the TV Times and an Augustus Gloop chocolate stash, scheduling movie-watching as if life depended on it. But hearing him murmur “he’s going to die” 10 minutes past the opening credits makes me want to stuff overpriced popcorn into his mouth till he’s picking it out of his nostrils. I’m not totally cruel: I would allow a breathing hole, so we can watch the rest of the film in blissful silence.

And when I watched it years later, I didn’t want to see it coming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jul/26/features.comment\">John Schlesinger: Picture imperfect</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I’m no cowboy but I’m a real stud,” Joe keeps telling us. Joe Buck (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000685/\">Jon Voight)</a> is tall, tanned and beautiful but he’s a man with no one, passing through the script of a wretched life. Leaving behind more than one person’s quota of dreadful luck in small-town Texas – abandoned by a mother, raised by a grandmother and her creepy partner – memories float through his mind, with flashbacks of a horrific rape of himself and his girlfriend at the hands of a local gang. Joe’s promiscuity, a calling card for sexual abuse, is also his escape. He plans to milk those rich ladies of New York, and turn the tables on his sexual exploitation.</p> <p>However, a few months in the city leave him sharp-cheekboned and pale. You wonder how many people it will take to screw him over before he realises that the only way to survive the urban jungle is to become a monstrous version of himself. Despite the bravado, Joe remains a man-boy, kind to the core and incapable of hurting others. As he admits at the end: “I’m not much of a hustler.” Bad luck follows him like a cloud. You want to shake him by those broad shoulders. <br /></p> <p>His unconventional relationship with Ratso (Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, played by Dustin Hoffman) is the closest thing to love that Joe has had in his life – it is no irony that this partnership is never sexual. Offering Joe food and shelter and cleaning his clothes (even if it is to earn money as his pimp), Ratso is the only one who places Joe’s needs above his own sexual gratification.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFoaj8utio\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jnFoaj8utio?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Just as Joe is starting to succeed at getting women to pay him for sex, Ratso’s health deteriorates. Joe makes his partner’s dreams of “Flawida” happen. As the bus heads south, Joe takes charge of Ratso’s incontinence and shame, using boyish humour: “You took a little rest stop that wasn’t on the schedule, is all.” And they both dissolve into giggles.</p> <p>Joe is at peace, and because of Ratso’s dream, he has diverted his escape plan to a land of hope and coconut palms. Ratso tells Joe he wants to be known as Ricco, the cowboy boots go into the bin, and the morning sun kisses their faces. Hope beckons. And then Joe turns to Ratso, who has died with eyes open, staring down the road to Miami. Joe takes into his arms the most enduring love he has ever known, once again alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"effd7b6a4ca4b5e163532177ea9ac47c8ba614bb\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426268803975/815025f7-fbe9-48c4-ac60-9137a7bfeda5-460x328.jpeg\" alt=\"'I'm walking here' … Midnight Cowboy (1969).\" width=\"460\" height=\"328\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’m walking here’ … Midnight Cowboy (1969).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap Stills/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I cry out of shock at the normality of their demise. I cry at the women in cat’s eye glasses who just stare, void of compassion, as grotesque as those rich New York ladies and their lookalike dogs.</p> <p>There are plenty of films which have an off-the-cliff ending, where the world stops. But usually with some sort of fanfare. It’s Joe’s unseen pain that has me bawling every time. I’m crying from a childish hope; the notion that things should get better, that it will be OK in the end. Even after the pointless death of Peter Fonda’s Wyatt in Easy Rider, I felt: well, at least he lived some.</p> <p>With Ratso gone, there is no one to tell Joe’s story; no advocate: he’s just not articulate enough. His mind paralysed at the time of the abuse, Joe retreats into his childish alter ego, alone and scared. Maybe what stirs me most is the realisation that no one has ever loved Joe as much as Ratso.

work-in-progress version of his new film Trainwreck at SXSW, and received an enthusiastic response from fans at the festival.</p> <p>The film, written by its star, Amy Schumer, focuses on a heavy-drinking, sexually promiscuous journalist whose use-them-and-lose them approach to sexual partners comes into question when she meets and falls for sports doctor Aaron Conners (Bill Hader).</p> <p>It’s a typical Apatow project with laughs at every turn, but tempered by more serious moments and narrative moves, such as Schumer’s relationship with her father (played by Colin Quinn). </p> <p>Schumer said the film was drawn from some of her own experiences growing up in New York.</p> <p>“I was born and raised in New York City, and then we went bankrupt and moved to Long Island,” Schumer explained. “I write everything I write in New York. I can’t imagine having a big kitchen.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/feb/12/trainwreck-trailer-amy-schumer-judd-apatow\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/45mh3\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2240679\"                data-video-name=\"Watch the trailer for Amy Schumer and Judd Apatow's buzzed-about comedy Trainwreck – video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/2/12/1423740898682/crop_KP_93704_640x360.png\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-455406993\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/2/12/1423740895087/crop_KP_93704_1200x720.png\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/02/12/150212Trainwreck_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/02/12/150212Trainwreck.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/02/12/150212Trainwreck_small.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10086472&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/02/12/150212Trainwreck_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Judd Apatow revealed at the screening that Schumer had originally submitted a different script before he encouraged her to make the project more self-indulgent.</p> <p>The film’s long list of stars includes Brie Larson, who plays Schumer’s sister Kim, and Tilda Swinton, who is almost unrecognisable as Dianna, the abrasive editor of the gaudy and cynical style magazine S’nuff for which Schumer’s character works.</p> <p>Australian comic Claudia O’Doherty has a small role, Vanessa Bayer and Ezra Miller play Schumer’s colleagues, and WWE wrestler John Cena plays a love interest. There are funny cameos from basketball stars Lebron James and Amar’e Stoudemire.</p> <p>Schumer looks set to become the latest star to be given a helping hand from Apatow, who has worked with Melissa McCarthy, Lena Dunham, James Franco and Seth Rogen. Schumer already has a cult following due to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/feb/09/inside-amy-schumer-judd-apatow\">her successful show</a> on Comedy Central, but Trainwreck is her first starring role.

that <a href=\"http://www.openculture.com/2014/07/stanley-kubrick-faked-the-apollo-11-moon-landing-45-years-ago-or-so-the-conspiracy-theory-goes.html\">Stanley Kubrick was employed by the CIA to fake the Apollo 11 moon landings</a>. This is the jumping off point for the dodgy comedy <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2718440/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm\">Moonwalkers</a>. Set in 1969 (obviously), it stars <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000579/\">Hellboy’s Ron Perlman </a>as Kidman, a CIA agent searching for Kubrick in Swinging London, and ending up with a hapless band manager played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/05/rupert-grint-stage-debut-interview\">Rupert Grint </a>masterminding the footage America needs in case the real-life space odyssey goes awry. </p> <p>It’s hard to imagine a film less like one of Kubrick’s, an idea which must have tickled director Antoine Bardou-Jacquet. Sadly, Moonwalkers is not just a mile from its inspiration in style, but in quality. Despite some decent performances from Gint as Jonny, the hapless manager of a terrible rock band, a swivel-eyed Pearlman afflicted by flashbacks from Nam and Robert Sheehan as the permanently wasted friend Leon dragooned into standing in for Kubrick, the film is only intermittently funny, and its targets – camp experimental filmmakers, meatheaded Hell’s Angels, deluded wannabe rock stars – are not so much tired as catatonic. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KopFza4ngU\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5KopFza4ngU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>When things look in danger of flagging, which is frequently, Bardou-Jacquet adds a lavish sprinking of topless women and throws in yet another drug-taking scene, culminating in the inevitable apocalyptic acid trip. While celebrity rubberneckers may enjoy seeing Harry Potter star Grint getting in amongst it, that’s the only note of subversion the film contains. Billed as an action comedy, Moonwalkers is also incongruously violent, with (for instance) a public-toilet beating too brutal for hilarity, though Bardou-Jacquet has fun with the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066214/\">Performance</a>-style Cockney gangsters led by a godfather who’s making a matchstick model of the Tower of London, before Perman furiously smashes it to smithereens. </p> <p>The funniest bits play on the differences between the Brits (effete, stoned and useless) and the Yanks (macho, ernest and dim), and there’s a decent joke about 2001: A Space Odyssey. But what sinks Moonwalkers is not that it’s broad and crude, but that it fatally lacks decent gags. </p>","headline":"Moonwalkers first look review – Kubrick myth becomes misfiring

first look review - feelgood fanaticism that's Boys Own stuff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fan fiction has become a staple of online life, as people create loving remakes of everything from Star Wars to the Power Rangers on their mobile phones. </p> <p>But Chris Strompolos and Eric Zala come from different stock. Beginning in the pre-internet world of 1982, when they were just 11-year-olds, they painstakingly retold Raiders of the Lost Ark, shot-for-shot, from their home in Mississippi.</p> <p>Their story captured the imagination of Jeremy Coon and Tim Skousen, who after seeing the film at a festival in Salt Lake City fell in love with it and its unlikely creators.</p> <p>“I thought it didn’t really exist because it wasn’t online and I couldn’t really find anything,” explains Coon. </p> <p>“I went on a Saturday afternoon to go see it, with no expectations – there were about 20 people there – and about 15 minutes in I was just engrossed. I turned to my friend and said: ‘Why do I not know about this? Someone needs to tell the story – like, where are the kids’ parents? What’s going on?’”</p> <p>Chris Strompolos, who plays Indiana Jones in the movie, was at the screening. Coon spoke to him and then called Skousen, who came onboard. Strompolos and Zala had turned down previous offers to make documentaries based on their film, but this time they gave Coon and Skousen access to their lives and their attempt to shoot the only scene that evaded them in the 80s: the penultimate scene, when Indy fights a Nazi soldier and blows up a 75ft airplane.</p> <p>“The awesome thing about Chris and Eric is once they’re onboard, they’re onboard,” says Coon. “There’s no ‘oh crap, we made a mistake’. As soon as we got the paperwork signed with them they shipped me a giant box with everything – the video tapes, everything you could think of – and they were like: ‘Ok, have at it.’”</p> <p>“So much of this stuff is already there because they filmed it when they were kids,” says Skousen. “Then when the airplane scene came along, that really gave us trajectory because we weren’t just telling this incredible story of a relationship and then it falling apart, but you have them going on the adventure again and we get to go with them.”</p> <p>The adventure isn’t just about on-set strife, although there is quite a lot if it. The film’s real focus is the relationship between Strompolos and Zala as they come to terms with past fallings out – they went years without speaking – and individual balancing acts as they try to finish the project while juggling family life and corporate jobs.</p> <p>“It’s scary to trust someone to tell your life story,” says Zala. “We wanted it to be warts and all. Real life is messy.”<br /></p> <p>And at times, Raiders! is close to the bone. There’s Zala’s fraught phone conversation with his boss at a video game testing company, who is loathe to give him any time off. There are Strompolos’s past issues with drug addiction. Most explosively, there’s the climax of the film when things on set involving the 75ft airplane, their pyro guy and some C4 explosives go very wrong indeed.</p> <p>“I was up on the hill and thought someone had been killed, and I thought, ‘We have no movie now,’” says Coon.</p> <p>“I was tearing up and I felt like I was in a war zone. It was really, really crazy,” adds Skousen. “I went into shock.”</p> <p>As things descended into chaos on set, off set and back in the real world, Coon and Skousen felt a responsiblity for Strompolos and Zala as the remake started to affect their real life. </p> <p>“We didn’t intervene with hardly anything, we just observed but there were times when I was like: ‘If [Zala’s] really going to quit his job, I might have to intervene,’” he explains. “I was like: ‘Hey, let’s pause and think about this because I really don’t want to ruin your life.’”</p> <p>Zala is still in his video game job, while Strompolos is attempting to work in movies full time. They certainly don’t seem like people whose lives have been ruined – more reignited. </p> <p>“I can’t go back to schlumpy, cubicle land,” says Strompolos. “I’d kill myself.”</p> <p>With Raiders! looking for distributors, it looks like he might not have to any time soon. </p>","headline":"Raiders! director: 'I felt like I was in a war zone' helping finish a childhood project","trailText":"SXSW film offers ‘warts and all’ story of two men given the chance to complete an ambitious effort from their youth: a homemade Indiana Jones film","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/15/1426450228455/131375f8-1d8e-441a-87df-240575055cd6-140x84.png","wordcount":"730","commentable":"true","byline":"Lanre Bakare in Austin","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-03-18T17:00:00-04:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/mar/15/raiders-director-sxsw-chris-strompolos-eric-zala","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global/2015/mar/15/raiders-director-sxsw-chris-strompolos-eric-zala","sectionName":"Global","tags":[{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"film/sxsw-film","webTitle":"SXSW Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sxsw-film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/sxsw-film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"music/sxsw-2015","webTitle":"SXSW 2015","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/sxsw-2015","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/sxsw-2015","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/lanre-bakare","webTitle":"Lanre Bakare","r2ContributorId":"43836","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/1/1359726347266/Lanre-Bakare_v2.jpg","firstName":"lanre","lastName":"bakare","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Lanre Bakare is commissioning editor at Guardian US, based in New York.

half of the Duplass brothers used his SXSW keynote speech to promote grassroots film-making and offer a how-to for underground directors</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>The key to becoming a successful and fulfilled independent filmmaker is shooting films on your mobile phone for $3 and never giving in to the temptation of studio schmaltz, according to Mark Duplass, the co-creator of Togetherness.</p> <p>In his keynote speech at SXSW in Austin, the filmmaker outlined his step-by-step survival guide for young directors who don’t want to compromise in order to get their films made.</p> <p>“The first step is the $3 short film,” he said. “We’re in a place now where technology is so cheap that there’s no excuse for you not to be making films on the weekends with your friends, shot on your iPhone – we had a feature film at Sundance this year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/25/sundance-2015-review-tangerine-iphone-film-movie\">that was shot entirely on iPhones</a> and it did really well.”</p> <p>He explained that along with his brother Jay, he had lived in Austin, working as an editor, before saving enough money to make their first feature film, Vince Del Rio, which cost $65,000 and was, in his words, “a steaming pile of dog diarrhea”. </p> <p>Despite the film tanking, the brothers decided to take a lo-fi approach with their next film, The New Brad, which was shot on their parents’ dysfunctional video camera, cost $3 and ended up at SXSW and Sundance.</p> <p>“It changed everything for us,” said Duplass. “Because it really doesn’t matter what your movie looks like – because if you have a voice and something interesting to say they will like you and they will program you.”</p> <p>He recommended making a $3 film every weekend with “your smartest group of friends”, made up of four or five people including a charismatic lead actor. Detailing his approach further, he said the film should be one scene, five minutes, ideally comedic and/or short – “because they program well at festivals” – and he warned filmmakers to be prepared for failure. Despite that, he insisted that being myopic and inward-looking when making one’s first films was definitely a good thing.</p> <p>“At the risk of saying you should make a self-indulgent film for your first movie: you should make a self-indulgent film for your first movie.”</p> <p>Other advice for would-be filmmakers included having a really strong day job (he recommended being a Spanish or Mandarin translator because of the demand and high pay), and saving money in order to travel and submit short films to film festivals.</p> <p>Turning down money offered by agents – “to avoid being stuck in development for five years” – shooting on mobile devices and asking friends and colleagues for favours were all recommended by Duplass, who called his approach “the available materials school of filmmaking”. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/feb/02/togetherness-new-hbo-show\">Togetherness: the Duplass brothers grow up in their new HBO sitcom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Duplass, along with his brother Jay, became known for a string of lo-fi, neurosis-laden comedies including The Puffy Chair and Cyrus before they landed roles in television shows such as The Mindy Project, The League and Transparent. He said that transitioning from film to television was another smart move for up-and-coming filmmakers.</p> <p>“As the death of the middle class of film has happened, it has been re-birthed in television,” he said. “The way you used to make really awesome $5m movies that didn’t have movie stars in them and had really great, cool original content, that’s happening in cable TV right now.”</p> <p>The Duplass brothers followed their own rules to land their HBO show Togetherness, which focuses on the anxieties of a group of 30 somethings as they cope with growing into middle age. The show was renewed <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hbos-togetherness-renewed-second-season-767774\">for a second season</a> and the brothers recently signed a four-film deal with Netflix at Sundance.</p>","headline":"Mark Duplass: 'There's no excuse not to make films on weekends with friends'","trailText":"One half of the Duplass brothers used his SXSW keynote speech to promote grassroots film-making and offer a how-to for underground directors","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/15/1426441483004/2959f843-f6a0-4d72-8747-b6ea0256eb54-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"603","commentable":"true","byline":"Lanre Bakare in Austin","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-03-18T15:30:00-04:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/15/mark-duplass-south-by-southwest-sxsw","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/mar/15/mark-duplass-south-by-southwest-sxsw","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/sxsw-film","webTitle":"SXSW Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sxsw-film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/sxsw-film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"music/sxsw-2015","webTitle":"SXSW 2015","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/sxsw-2015","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/sxsw-2015","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/lanre-bakare","webTitle":"Lanre Bakare","r2ContributorId":"43836","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/1/1359726347266/Lanre-Bakare_v2.jpg","firstName":"lanre","lastName":"bakare","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Lanre Bakare is commissioning editor at Guardian US, based in New York.

Taya Kyle, wife of American Sniper subject Chris Kyle, prepares to release a book, Taryn Davis’s support network helps others face devastation</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>When her 22-year-old husband was killed by roadside bombs while serving in Iraq in 2007, Taryn Davis searched the internet for help.</p> <p>“I Googled ‘widow’ and got the response: ‘Do you mean window?’” she said. “That really was a huge catalyst to me, to think that there were other women possibly out there that had Googled ‘widow’ too and either got that response or lots of pictures of spiders.”</p> <p>Nearly 7,000 US service members have been killed since the “war on terror” began in 2001, creating thousands of bereaved young spouses like Davis, who was 21 when corporal Michael Davis died in Baghdad. Half those killed were aged under 25. More than half of active duty members are married.</p> <p>Google “military widow” today and one of the first results is the Texas-based non-profit organisation Davis founded after her husband’s death, <a href=\"http://americanwidowproject.org/stories/\">the American Widow Project</a>. It provides nationwide support services and its website has collected hundreds of stories of grief, loss and love. </p> <p>Taya Kyle is about to shine a spotlight on life as a military widow, with the publication in May of American Wife: A Memoir of Love, War, Faith and Renewal, and <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2015/03/abc-news-exclusive-robin-roberts-to-interview-taya-kyle-wife-of-american-sniper-chris-kyle-for-her-memoir-american-wife-a-memoir-of-love-war-faith-and-renewal/\">a carefully coordinated publicity campaign</a>.</p> <p>It will detail her life before and after the death of Chris Kyle, the subject of the book and blockbuster film American Sniper. Considered the deadliest sniper in US military history, Kyle left the US navy in 2009 and was murdered on a Texas gun range in 2013 by Eddie Ray Routh, a troubled former Marine who last month was sentenced to life in prison for the crime.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/25/american-sniper-trial-eddie-ray-routh-found-guilty-and-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-without-parole\">'American Sniper' killer Eddie Ray Routh found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without parole</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Taya Kyle, 40, provided emotional testimony in court about her family life, is a regular guest speaker on military issues and has given interviews to help promote the film. In the middle of the trial she flew to Los Angeles to attend <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/american-sniper-chris-kyle-widow-taya-kyle-copinghttp://www.harpercollinsspeakersbureau.com/speaker/taya-kyle/\">the Academy Awards</a>, walking the red carpet with her late husband’s dog tags. Clint Eastwood’s film was nominated for six Oscars, including best picture, winning one, for best sound editing.</p> <p>“The story she’s sharing is one of thousands that haven’t really been told, and for her to bring light to her strife and her pain in hopes that someone else knows they’re not alone and that they can get through it and their grief is normal – whatever normal is – I commend that,” said Davis.</p> <p>“When I saw American Sniper came out, for me I personally thought: ‘That’s something I don’t want to see because it might bring back images of what happened to my husband,’” she said. “For some people, reading the book might bring them back to a place that they don’t want to go back to. For others it might take them to a place where they realise how far they’ve come.”</p> <p>Joanne Steen’s husband, Ken, was killed in 1992 along with six others when their navy helicopter exploded in mid-air during a training exercise in Virginia. She is now an advisor on line-of-duty loss and a co-author of Military Widow: A Survival Guide. The book was published 14 years after Ken’s death. </p> <p>“It was difficult for me to write it because I had to ‘resurrect’ my late husband,” Steen said. “Most people write about their experiences, what losing a service member means to them, but few write about what military widowhood is like. </p> <p>“What happens is that you end up with a public identity – hey, I’m a military widow – that’s recognised in society. And then you also have the private identity of losing a spouse. [Attention] helps to keep your husband’s memory out there because a big fear of survivors is that our loved ones will be forgotten.”</p> <p>Steen said she admired Kyle’s decision to attend the Oscars. “I personally was happy to see her there, as another widow. She was dealt an incredibly tough blow; all widows are, but she was dealt an incredibly tough blow. I expect it has not been easy with all that publicity.”</p> <p>Kyle has also, largely behind the scenes, had to handle disputes related to the profits from the film and book, as well as <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/american-sniper-chris-kyles-widow-773524\">a defamation lawsuit</a> brought by the former Minnesota governor and ex-professional wrestler Jesse Ventura.</p> <p>The government provides <a href=\"http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.specialops.org/resource/resmgr/survivors_guidelr.pdf\">potentially significant levels of financial assistance</a> to bereaved spouses, although the bureaucracy <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/27/us/27benefits.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">can be hard to navigate</a> for some.</p> <p>Steen and Davis said military widowhood presents specific emotional challenges because such women are usually very young and the armed forces can represent a painful reminder of the tragedy as well as being a possible support network. Something as simple as seeing the American flag is capable of sparking painful memories while knowledge that the partner is in a dangerous job is no preparation for the shock of a loss.</p> <p>“These service members usually die suddenly and they’re often catastrophic deaths, often traumatic deaths,” Steen said. “So as a widow you’re at a time when you’re beginning life and you’re creating life – marriage, babies, things like that.</p> <p>“You don’t have very often the experience or the maturity to deal with a traumatic death … My husband and I had ‘the talk’ about what would happen should he crash. Did I think it would happen? Heck no. Did I worry? Heck yes. You may worry that it’s going to happen but you don’t necessarily expect it to happen.”</p> <p>Like Kyle, many are widowed after their partner has left the military. The suicide rate among veterans is far higher than in the general population, with <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2015/feb/27/johnny-isakson/rate-not-just-number-helps-explain-vet-suicide-ris/\">an estimated 8,000 killing themselves</a> annually.</p> <p>“A lot of the military widows we serve come to our events and share that they walked upstairs to find a note on the door saying ‘call 9-1-1’ and opened the door to see their spouse had [hanged] themselves or wrapped themselves in a sheet and shot himself in the head, or their kids found them in the basement,” said Davis.</p> <p>She was 21 when her husband died and said she created the Project to fill a gap. “I was provided with leaflets that the military recommended, was reached out to by other organisations, but when I researched them I either saw the images I expected to see of what a widow is or I saw organisations that seemed to be based around which politician supported their cause or which major sponsor just funded their yearly budget. </p> <p>“And at that point I was at an all-time low. I think people thought that because I was so young it would be easy to just recuperate and sweep it under the rug and in all honesty it was more difficult than anything I could have fathomed.</p> <p>“You’re kind of like a zombie. You’re going through these motions and you’re putting on a smile outwards to make other people feel comfortable. When people ask how you’re doing you just say: ‘I’m fine,’ but in reality you think ‘I want to kill myself, I feel desperate, I feel lonely; the person I talked to for everything is gone.’”</p> <p>Even widespread sympathy can be hard to handle. “There were almost 1,000 people at his funeral. So every time I went to the grocery store I’d see people come up and say: ‘We’re thinking of you, we’re sorry,’” Davis said.</p> <p>“I was afraid to laugh in public for over a year after Michael’s death because I was in such a small town and I thought ‘OK, the first time somebody sees me laugh, they’re going to think I’m over Michael, that I’m not hurting, that I’m not in pain.’ </p> <p>“I want people to know that grief is a lifetime process. If 50 years from now I’m remarried with three kids and 12 grandkids, what happened to Michael and what happened to me because of his sacrifice is something that I will struggle with at all times, and that awareness and acceptance is what makes it easier for me. And so we want to create an environment for that.”</p>","headline":"'Grief is a lifetime process': American military widows unite to face their loss","trailText":"Taryn Davis hit an ‘all-time low’ after her husband’s death in Iraq, and now her American Widow Project helps others face the same devastation","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/15/1426444304357/729592e6-1d38-49aa-b1c7-3ca280c85653-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1341","commentable":"true","byline":"Tom Dart in Houston","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-03-18T15:00:00-04:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/15/military-widows-taya-kyle-taryn-davis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2015/mar/15/military-widows-taya-kyle-taryn-davis","sectionName":"US news","tags":[{"id":"us-news/us-military","webTitle":"US military","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-military","sectionName":"US news","references":[]},{"id":"film/american-sniper","webTitle":"American Sniper","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/american-sniper","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/american-sniper","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","sectionName":"US news","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tom-dart","webTitle":"Tom Dart","r2ContributorId":"50797","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/9/1336571916728/Tom-Dart-003.jpg","firstName":"tom","lastName":"dart","twitterHandle":"Tom_Dart","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tom Dart is a Houston-based freelance journalist.

The first is that he’s the best actor of his generation. Al Pacino has been <a href=\"http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2015-01/20/mark-rylance-interview-bbc-wolf-hall-thomas-cromwell\">saying so for years</a>: “Rylance speaks Shakespeare as if it was written for him the night before.” Theatre types cite seminal <a href=\"http://shakespeare.berkeley.edu/index.php?option=com_g2bridge&amp;view=gallery&amp;Itemid=256&amp;g2_view=core%3AShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=19209&amp;g2_imageViewsIndex=1\">Romeos</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW9tu1i1UgA\">Richards</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/aug/22/10-best-hamlets-david-tennant\">Hamlets</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/nov/18/twelfth-night-richard-iii-review\">Olivias</a>, Rooster from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up3M7WOPsg4\"> Jerusalem</a>, Bernard from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZTEVnzcneU\">Boeing Boeing</a>. Sean Penn has courted him since 1995; photos of them at the premiere of the movie they have finally made show Penn saucer-eyed with adoration, Charlize Theron looking on.</p> <p>But Rylance love-bombing only took off as a mainstream activity after Wolf Hall introduced his brimful features to BBC2. His Thomas Cromwell is like Hilary Mantel’s books: hard to read yet impossible to put down. The general <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/15/bbc-worldwide-showcase-wolf-hall\">verdict</a>: Bafta must create new categories to accommodate his genius.</p> <p>The second thing people tend to mention about Rylance is that he’s a bit of a fruitloop. A hippy – a pagan, even – who got married on <a href=\"http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=140\">ancient stones</a> over the winter solstice, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2962466/Cromwell-eco-warrior-Wolf-Hall-star-Mark-Rylance-hits-streets-electric-car-anti-fracking-sticker.html\">drives a G-Wiz</a>, places faith in crop circles and wear hats indoors (today’s has a brooch on it in the shape of a bluebottle). Two days before we meet, he explains on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0520t2t\">Desert Island Discs</a> how, in 1987, torn between Steven Spielberg’s Empire of the Sun or the new RSC season, he turned for guidance to Chinese dice the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching\">I Ching</a>. In this paper – which is also Rylance’s paper – we followed it up with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/feb/16/mark-rylance-used-i-ching-for-career-can-it-help-chose-my-lunch\">a piece asking the I Ching what to have for lunch</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8dda9e1348d35aca6e81411161b7d11410eb6e1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426262913304/bf38161b-ca2e-4ffe-9049-c2c2f9b61cef-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rylance in Wolf Hall.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rylance in Wolf Hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Keyte/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He raises it, smile light, slightly disappointed. “I’m aware of being a subject of fun. I probably do wear foolish clothes and say foolish things. If I take offence, it’s my fault.”</p> <p>As established, Rylance is the world’s greatest actor. Certainly, if anyone can put on a good show, it’s this guy (in his 20s he did, he says, have “issues with honesty”). Maybe, even those two givens – the wonderful plausibility and the weird credulity – are linked. Yet my bullshit detector never blips, even when he explains how the mind has two genders and is quite like a womb. Rather, Rylance just seems like one of the gentlest men I’ve met: all twinkle and fragility, no trace of Cromwell’s implacable hatchet-face.</p> <p>Penn says he most envies him his kindness. Today, Rylance’s capacity for empathy even seems to stretch to the Fifty Shades of Grey movie (“vulnerable”, “such a well-intentioned thing”). Yes, he says softly, of course that plant on the table has a soul, as do dogs and rocks. “Of course the river has its own right to exist.” Such logic is presented as simple thought-evolution: “There was a time when people thought only white men had souls.”</p> <p>He tells a story about a shaman he knows who was correctly warned by a coyote that his son was in danger. “And on the news the other day there was this amazing thing about dogs smelling prostate cancer in urine! And cats being trained to detect breast cancer in women! Maybe in 50 years they’ll just see not only how cruel we were to torture and kill and eat animals, but how foolish not to develop a healing relationship with them.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4354c05cc39991bbb3cb51e4d2419c5b49e3fe09\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426262953706/226bc8fb-dc51-413f-ba58-9b38bfce5f49-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"With Sean Penn in The Gunman.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Sean Penn in The Gunman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/STUDIOCANAL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He sips his virgin Mary – no celery, head of pepper, massive olive courtesy of Theron, with whom he’s just had lunch. We’re at London’s Soho Hotel on a press day for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug9xufczPVE\">The Gunman</a>, a high-body-count thriller from the director of Taken. At 55, Rylance is still fresh enough on the junket scene to look up the original meaning of the word (“custard”). He plays Terry, a banker who once ran a Congo-based squad of assassins (including Penn and Ray Winstone). As projects go, it feels a bit skew whiff for a pacifist so committed that he winces at the very mention of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/american-sniper\">American Sniper</a>.</p> <p>Well, he says, the film has a lot about the exploitation of Africa’s natural resources by multinationals (“western cosmology seems to be more about dominating nature than working with it”). Penn’s veneration is genuine and hard to resist. Likewise a <a href=\" http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2015-01/20/mark-rylance-interview-bbc-wolf-hall-thomas-cromwell\">“ridiculous amount of money”</a> for eight days shooting.</p> <p>Plus, he says, invoking Bob Dylan for the first of many times, <a href=\"http://genius.com/Bob-dylan-union-sundown-lyrics\">the world is ruled by violence</a>. But don’t such movies glamorise it? “I hope the jury is out. I don’t think the majority of people are encouraged to go and kill. I think the film could be more complex, probably, but I don’t think it’s mindless. It doesn’t mean that if somebody attacked my wife I wouldn’t, in a rage, kill them, but I would be ashamed of it afterwards.”</p> <p>Capacity for killing aside, Rylance has little in common with either of his characters in The Gunman or Wolf Hall. Both are sober operators carefully calculating their way to the top. Rylance seeps compassion. His eyebrows seem to be speaking even when their owner isn’t. Cromwell is cool and detached save for an odd flash of emotion so transfixing that people glue themselves to the telly, twitcher-style, hoping for a glimpse. Most memorable, maybe, was the one that closed the series: Cromwell’s frightened eyes locked in an embrace by the monarch.</p> <p>That’s a reason the show struck such a chord, thinks Rylance: people sympathise with the position. “It’s an awful thing to be aware of your own corruption. I think a lot of people are bound by the particular economic system we work in to serve companies and masters who aren’t really telling people what they’re doing.” Corporate buck-passing has meant it’s generally acceptable to abdicate responsibility. “As a leader you get a pat on the back when you make a hard choice.” That’s why Blair agreed to go into Iraq, he thinks: to prove to Bush he had the balls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a24d377158fd3cae435269630f6124609272c574\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426263003479/b7c20f25-44e6-4bc0-bd74-5c2284cf7cb5-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Rylance with his wife, wife Claire van Kampen.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rylance with his wife, Claire van Kampen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA WIRE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wolf Hall seems prescient in other ways, too. There were echoes of Ebola in the first-episode death of Cromwell’s wife and daughters. Then came the beheadings and immolations; news reports broadcast afterwards showed Isis meting out much the same treatment.</p> <p>“It was the 15th century of Christianity and my understanding is we’re in the 15th century of Islam,” says Rylance. “In Europe we went through an enormous period of sectarianism, like Islam is at the moment. We, of course, didn’t have the Americans and the English bombing the hell out of us, and poisoning our children for 50,000 years with depleted uranium.”</p> <p>His voice rises in upset. “I can’t believe even in the Guardian people ask the questions: ‘Where did Isis come from?’ ‘How did this happen?’ ‘Why do young Muslim women go off to join them?’ Maybe because we’ve been degrading their people since 1917. Maybe their teenage years are a little bit more stressed than that of Christianity.”</p> <p>In the past, he’s been quoted as despising religion and science. Not true, he says. “I just see there being some similarities between the scientific cosmology that dominates at the moment and the religious. They both have heresies and, in the end, they’re both man-made definitions.”</p> <p>Does he believe? Yes: not in a human deity but “images of archetypal energies”. Still, he can see why Stephen Fry (Malvolio to his Olivia in Twelfth Night) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/feb/01/stephen-fry-god-evil-maniac-irish-tv\">sticks with science</a>. “A lot of my gay friends feel so angry about religion and its ridiculous condemnation – as if God would give a fuck about that.” Broadly, though, he appreciates the consolation. “I think the idea that life ends when we physically die is as painful as the idea in Cromwell’s time that there’s some awful purgatory, and you have to give money to the Catholic church to get your loved ones out.” A pause. “I certainly have experienced a lot of evidence that there’s a consciousness that isn’t physical.”</p> <p>Rylance was born in 1960 in Sissinghurst, Kent. The family – both parents were teachers – moved to the US when he was two. He couldn’t speak properly until he was six, just vowelly yowling, intelligible only to his siblings. This was his subconscious shrinking at the prospect of all the public speaking to come, he’s said – today he relates it to the BFG, whom he plays in Spielberg’s new movie. “I love that he makes up words and can’t always be held accountable. We value clarity too much. The Greeks considered it only one of the seven modes of expression.”</p> <p>Once he found his voice, he acted all round the house; at eight solemnly recreating Robert Kennedy’s funeral. He still sees vestiges of “crude early dramatic stances” in Wolf Hall. “I’m annoyed if I see myself putting on a kind of victim face. When I was a kid, one of the best ways to improvise was to go: ‘Oh the Klingons are attacking!’ or ‘Oh, I’ve been shot!’” He laughs hard and quite high-pitched.</p> <p>At 18, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jul/01/mark-rylance-jerusalem-much-ado-interview\">auditioned for Rada</a> and moved to London. His rise was swift: Glasgow Citizens Theatre, then to the RSC (not Spielberg, not yet) for Hamlet and Romeo, helped by many mentors. “Sometimes the person who can spot the diamond in a young person is not the one to whom they’re related. That’s the case with the BFG and the little girl he kidnaps.

He performed his own play, I am Shakespeare, about the authorship debate, then won every theatrical gong going for Boeing Boeing, then again for Jerusalem.</p> <p>In 1987, Rylance met composer Claire van Kampen, then married with two small daughters. In an evolved-sounding outcome, Rylance took over as “co-parent” to Nataasha and Juliet, and he and their father, Chris, go on annual <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/mark-rylance-king-of-stage-claims-small-screen-9999525.html\">walking holidays</a>. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliet_Rylance\">Juliet</a>, now 35, is an actor who took Rylance’s name; Nataasha, a production designer, died suddenly, aged 28, of a brain haemorrhage on a flight in July 2012. Rylance <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/06/mark-rylance-exits-olympics-opening\">pulled out of</a> the impending Olympics opening ceremony, but stuck with a commitment later that month at the Globe, as Olivia in Twelfth Night and as Richard III. He has spoken about his sense that Nataasha was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/9783657/Mark-Rylance-still-holds-conversations-with-his-late-stepdaughter.html\">speaking in his ear</a> while he was on stage.</p> <p>Look back at Rylance’s interviews before the tragedy – one, dreadfully, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjZxpATxUHs\">on the morning of it</a> – and there is a blitheness to him absent today. Yes, he says, people are drawn to solid narratives such as The Gunman because it’s such a confusing world. “I certainly am. One of the pleasures of being an actor is you can live in a clear narrative that’s moving forward from one position to another without such random and chaotic things happening.”</p> <p>He raises Nataasha’s death directly after I chirpily ask if he’s still vegetarian. “To some degree, all my principles went out the window when my daughter died. I couldn’t quite see the point of anything. It seemed like nothing really mattered. Why the fuck does it, you know? So I’m only kind of recovering my sense that what I do makes a difference.” I stutter condolences. “Well, lots of people have very difficult things happen.”</p> <p>Van Kampen continued to write a play, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/23/farinelli-and-the-king-review-mark-rylance\">Farinelli and the King</a>, which had a run last month at candlelit Globe annex the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, and will transfer to the West End in the autumn. Rylance is Philippe III of Spain, whose mood-swings were eased by the singing of legendary castrato Farinelli, whom he took along when he set up home, Good Life-style, in the woods.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6e5188900b6ca23e5848ea98cd252eb41369673\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426263078852/816a1ab2-f056-4ad1-bceb-a6751444702b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"As Rooster Byron in Jerusalem.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Rooster Byron in Jerusalem.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The play can be read as a manifesto for the couple’s ideas about the consolation of art and mutual benefits of a respect for nature. Rylance is excited about medical breakthroughs using sound and vibration to treat cancer and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/12/alzheimers-breakthrough-as-ultrasound-successfully-treats-disease-in-mice\">Alzheimer’s</a>. About how gravity can “lift the oceans as well as sensitive souls on a full moon night”. About the power of energies too subtle, he thinks, for us yet to have purchase on.</p> <p>The more you talk to Rylance, the more those two big pieces of received wisdom – the virtuosity and the eccentricity – do seem symbiotic. Usually, they’re seen as oppositional: great actor, shame about the native American blessing rituals. But Rylance’s eager suspension of disbelief in all areas is key to his ability. Says his friend <a href=\"http://www.oliviermythodrama.com/ourpeople3.asp?pagex=1&amp;staff=6\">Richard Olivier</a>: “The open-mindedness that he lives creates a non-judgmental approach to his characters. Of all the actors I know he is the closest to a modern shaman.”</p> <p>And when you ask people to identify exactly Rylance’s skill, it’s this sense of something slightly supernatural that stands out. Jerusalem author <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/may/14/saturday-interview-jez-butterworth\">Jez Butterworth</a> says the moment Rylance first transformed into Johnny Byron was “the closest thing to magic I’ve ever seen”. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/sep/30/mark-rylance-complicite-beckett-endgame\">Simon McBurney</a> says he’s often asked what Rylance’s secret is, “as if they need the answer to a mystery”. As for Penn, he reckons that as Rylance’s “craft has caught up to his personal poetry, he’s probably the closest thing to a magician we have in the field”.</p> <p>Oh yes, says Rylance, he believes in magic. Not in the kind that’s “an extension of the dominating mindset” but just “a very present and awakened state of being”. Prospero didn’t cause the storm, he merely channelled it. That’s how it is for him, too, he says, eyes glistening. “Ideas come to me that I do not feel are self-generating. As an artist, you receive ideas from the collective consciousness.” As a person, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0197c0886132d872b25a0a84fa906d2513210ac0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/15/1426442187881/9c302172-eb3f-4680-a4d8-e9a66179e1d5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rylance with a newly-discovered copy of the First Folio, February 2015.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rylance with a newly-discovered copy of Shakespeare’s First Folio, February 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once, he says, he was visiting a crop circle at the same time as a Mayan woman from Peru. Everyone else went in; she lay prostrate on the edge. “‘There’s no way I’m going in that thing with all that energy,’ she said. ‘If this happened in my country, they’d have built a stadium around it and it would be packed all the time with people just sitting there, looking at it.’”</p> <p>His face creases in frustration: as if someone crossed a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnauzer\">Schnauzer</a> with a pixie. “Our fact-based culture is so terrified by anything mysterious or inexplicable. Being curious outside the set cosmology is still something of a sin. And it’s hard for those people to be faced by mockery and lies, to diminish the question. Life is so much more beautiful and undefinable than our culture seems to admit to.” He grins, shrugs, fishes out the olive, pops it in his mouth. “Though of course what’s nice is you can go to these places and there aren’t a lot of people there.”</p> <p><em>• The Gunman is released in the UK and US on 20 March</em></p>","headline":"The magic of Mark Rylance: ‘Our culture is terrified of anything mysterious’","trailText":"After decades of stage adulation, the Wolf Hall star has suddenly been catapulted into the mainstream.

Bruegel to Nabokov and The Silence of the Lambs, butterflies have flitted through our imaginations and into our culture. Patrick Barkham pins up the choice specimens – and finds out why new film The Duke of Burgundy is awash with them</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Signifying sunshine, beauty and freedom, butterflies are ubiquitous in our culture, ever-present on greeting cards and used to sell everything from oven chips to SUVs. For artists, novelists and film-makers, however, butterflies and moths have often taken on darker meanings. In John Fowles’s The Collector, the protagonist (played by Terence Stamp in the film adaptation) is a butterfly obsessive who decides to collect young women. In The Silence of the Lambs, a sinister-looking moth (actually the death’s-head hawkmoth) is a serial killer’s signature. And in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/duke-of-burgundy-review-toronto-film-festival\">The Duke of Burgundy</a>, a new film by Peter Strickland, the story of an S&amp;M relationship is told through butterflies and moths. How have these insects come to symbolise sexual deviancy?</p> <p>Artists have been seeing the human spirit in lepidoptera for centuries. The earliest-known depictions are of the eyed hawkmoth and the peacock butterfly in Pyrenees cave paintings. According to Peter Marren, author of new book <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/rainbow-dust-three-centuries-of-delight-in-british-butterflies/9780224098656\">Rainbow Dust: Three Centuries of Delight in British Butterflies</a>, they appear on Minoan artefacts from Crete around 4,000 years ago, but it was the ancient Greeks who really shaped their use in culture, by explicitly linking them to the human soul. The Greek word for a butterfly and a soul is the same: psyche.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"736a73bf9a3deab093786248a4ef5fa42924b978\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426269582026/727de9ce-eab8-4f09-ba73-9cb611c2ad8e-460x338.jpeg\" alt=\"Terence Stamp in The Collector\" width=\"460\" height=\"338\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terence Stamp in The Collector.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It is striking how far this idea of the butterfly as a spirit goes back,” says Marren. “It’s probably preliterate. It seems to be endlessly repeated throughout civilisations.” As he writes, these free-flying insects are the closest thing the natural world offers to our concept of the untethered human spirit.</p> <p>By the 18th century, Christian butterfly collectors saw a religious parable in the insect’s life cycle. We were caterpillars, greedy worms condemned to toil on earth; the chrysalis was our coffin, but the butterfly’s miraculous emergence symbolised the possibility of an afterlife, a chance for our souls to ascend to heaven. Back down on earth, collecting was regarded as the ideal occupation for a vicar: less bloodthirsty than foxhunting, but still getting the reverend out and about in the parish.</p> <p>Butterflies have been considered to be human souls in many eras and cultures: in 17th-century Ireland, an edict forbade the killing of white butterflies because they were regarded as the souls of children. That may seem a little morbid, but it hardly paves the way for their sinister symbolism in today’s secular age. Marren’s research, however, reveals a long tradition of butterflies representing dark desires, fallen angels, temptation and death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a3f098d76686d78292d01beff44ffd0f8d44c189\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426269511942/c8b9cee1-3a2d-40e0-b100-a7bd72f410f5-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The Fall of the Rebel Angels, 1562, by Pieter Bruegel the Elder\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detail from The Fall of the Rebel Angels, 1562, by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Hieronymus Bosch’s best known work, <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/The_Garden_of_Earthly_Delights_by_Bosch_High_Resolution.jpg/1280px-The_Garden_of_Earthly_Delights_by_Bosch_High_Resolution.jpg\">The Garden of Earthly Delights</a>, painted at the start of the 16th century, there are two little devils with the wings of the small tortoiseshell and the meadow brown. In 1562, Pieter Bruegel the Elder gave his ringleader the wings of a swallowtail in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_the_Rebel_Angels_%28Bruegel%29\">The Fall of the Rebel Angels</a>. And Marren points out the long history of the red admiral butterfly as a symbol of “evil”: red represents danger in nature, and the superstitious saw its blood-red wings as a sign of foreboding when vast numbers of them appeared across Russia in 1881, when Tsar Alexander II was assassinated. Some believe that the date “1881” can be deciphered on the red admiral’s hind wings. <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/04/nabokovs-butterflies-introduction/378103/\">Vladimir Nabokov</a>, a brilliant lepidopterist as well as author, used the red admiral to sinister effect in his novel Pale Fire.</p> <p>Throughout his career, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/18/damien-hirst-butterflies-weirdly-uplifting\">Damien Hirst has used butterflies</a> (including live ones hatching in a gallery) to make statements about the fleeting nature of life. But in the 20th century, it was writers in particular who took advantage of the fact that collectors were increasingly regarded as creeps. Shortly before John Fowles’s The Collector appeared, Enid Blyton deployed a couple of collectors in her 1957 Famous Five adventure, Five Go to Billycock Hill: her depiction of two myopic butterfly-lovers is slyly homophobic. Marren, a keen naturalist, understands such sinister representations of collectors, however: “It could be considered obsessive, narrow-minded behaviour, and it features death and clinical things such as gas [in jars to kill them], shiny pins and helpless fluttering insects – you could easily make a nightmare out of it. And there have hardly been any women collectors.”</p> <p>It’s here that <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2570858/\">The Duke of Burgundy</a> strikes an innovative note: the film is set in a fantastical world populated only by women, all of whom are rapt attendees of drolly dull entomology lectures. It tells the story of the shifting balance of power between an apparently dominant butterfly professor called Cynthia (played by Sidse Babett Knudsen, the Danish PM in Borgen) and her lover Evelyn, a quakingly subservient maid (Chiara D’Anna). In writer-director Strickland’s first draft, there was only a single shot of a butterfly painting, but after he decided to make his lovers entomologists, the theme grew. As well as taking its name from <a href=\"http://butterfly-conservation.org/679-1100/duke-of-burgundy.html\">one of Britain’s rarest butterflies</a>, the film is dominated by images of live moths and dead butterflies in cases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bef1c1d05a5a5fd7a8f6ac1c0a7e447086a41ab5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426269697452/2374e091-ced7-4780-931b-fc31e54c4079-309x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Vladimir Nabokov\" width=\"309\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Nabokov.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Mydans/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I don’t want to pound people with metaphor or meaning,” <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/19/peter-strickland-katalin-varga-film-interview\">says Strickland</a>, “but they serve the film in terms of texture. Insects have this great otherness you wouldn’t get even with amphibians. There’s a temptation to go for the brightly coloured, but we tried to use dull ones. There’s a sensuousness to those wings. I can’t gauge whether this film is erotic or unerotic, but it is sensual. All those insect textures contribute somehow.”</p> <p>Strickland has form here: his breakthrough film, 2012’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/30/berberian-sound-studio-review\">Berberian Sound Studio</a>, features a sequence on Box Hill in Surrey, a famous butterfly hotspot, and mentions the rare silver-spotted skipper. But he says he is “a layman, maybe not even that” when it comes to insects. This time, filming on a tight budget in Hungary, Strickland borrowed butterfly collections from Budapest’s museum of natural history and then faced a big decision: should he hire expert advice from a dominatrix or a lepidopterist? He chose the latter. “We were terrified of telling him what the film was about,” he admits.</p> <p>Having an on-set entomologist helped deepen meanings in the film, and Strickland was particularly struck by the rich, strange language of lepidoptera. His lovers’ safe word is pinastri, the scientific name for the pine hawkmoth. “It sounded like ‘be nasty’. I love the idea of words having this incantatory quality – they become a kind of chant.”</p> <p>Other species are used very precisely in the film. The moth that Evelyn holds at the end is an old lady; and, given the bondage theme, it seems appropriate the true lover’s knot moth should appear. Characters’ names are similarly chosen: Cynthia is the scientific name of the painted lady, while Dr Viridana is named after the green oak moth (Tortix viridana).</p> <p>Ironically, despite all this, there isn’t actually a single live moth or butterfly in the film. Despite the typically eccentric “insects in order of appearance” at the end credits, they are all CGI. By the time Strickland was filming, in late autumn, all the big hawkmoths had vanished for the season.</p>","headline":"Wings of desire: how butterflies have captivated artists","trailText":"From Bruegel to Nabokov and The Silence of the Lambs, butterflies have flitted through our imaginations and into our culture.

Olivier Pilon caught critics’ attention playing a troubled teen in Mommy – next he wants to go even badder","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>The best part of shooting his new film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/mommy\"><em>Mommy</em></a>, says young Canadian actor <a href=\"https://instagram.com/antoineolivierpilon/\">Antoine Olivier Pilon</a>, was “the scene where I terrorise the taxi driver. Jumping on his roof, spitting on his windshield – that’s something I don’t get to do every day.” You can well imagine that he doesn’t. Sitting in his family’s home in Montreal, the 17-year-old Québécois is thoughtful, soft-spoken and altogether not much like his force-of-nature character Steve in <em>Mommy</em> – an intensely troubled boy with a tendency to rage and a borderline-oedipal relationship with his doting mother.</p> <p>This exuberantly demonstrative melodrama is the latest film from another enfant terrible, 25-year-old director <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230859/\">Xavier Dolan</a>. <em>Mommy</em> caused <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/21/cannes-2014-review-mommy\">much excitement in Cannes last year</a> – where it shared the Jury Prize with Jean-Luc Godard - and it certainly got Pilon noticed, one review hailing him as a cross between Jean-Paul Belmondo and “<a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/mommy-cannes-review-706363\">a demonically cherubic Macaulay Culkin</a>”.</p> <p>Despite the excitement, <em>Mommy</em> is not the most controversial thing that Pilon and Dolan have done together; that was a video for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp5U5mdARgY\">College Boy</a> by French group Indochine. The song is insipid, the video anything but: carrying an anti-bullying message, it stars Pilon as a brutalised schoolboy martyr. “My character gets crucified, shot, pissed on,” he says, slipping from French into English. “It was pretty intense. Xavier wanted people to feel directly attacked, to face them with something they didn’t want to feel implicated in.”</p> <p>Olivier and his older sister got the acting bug young, watching children on TV and wondering how they’d got there. When he was 10, he asked his parents to enter him for auditions, and he got his first lead film role two years later. He has been a fixture in Canadian film and TV ever since, but <em>Mommy</em> – which recently won him best actor in the Canadian Screen Awards – has really made people recognise him. That has its drawbacks. “People get scared to see me in the street, because they think I’m like the character in the movie.” It can only get worse, given his ambition: “I just want to work on even more intense characters now.”</p> <p>It’s quite a relief to be able to follow Pilon’s French: in person, his Québécois accent has only a mild twang as opposed to the teeth-aching intensity of the version in <em>Mommy</em>. The film exaggerates for effect, Pilon explains: “I normally wouldn’t speak like Steve every day.” Born in Montreal, Pilon spent six years of his childhood on the eastern peninsula of <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Peninsule+de+la+Gaspesie,+Mont-Albert,+QC+G0E,+Canada/@48.6184758,-66.3057454,5z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4c99f0d712a2398d:0x75252761901b49dd\">Gaspésie</a>. “The accent there is quite close to Steve’s,” Pilon says, giving me a sing-song sample, really putting his gullet into it. In France, he adds, “They can’t make head or tail of it – they have to show <em>Mommy</em> there with subtitles.”</p>","headline":"Antoine Olivier Pilon: ‘I just want to work on even more intense

pole dancing… the Divergent star on learning new life-skills, working on a biopic of Edward Snowden – and why she cleans her teeth with clay</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>As soon as I walk into her suite at London’s Soho hotel, Shailene Woodley bounds over and gives me a warm hug with a back-pat finisher. This is her thing – a courtesy extended to colleagues and sometimes journalists and fans – something she has said helps “to cut the bullshit” when she meets a new person. And hugging is really one of the lesser eccentricities of the 23-year-old American actress; others include brushing her teeth with clay, making her own deodorant and fixing home-made medicines<strong> </strong>when she’s under the weather. Unforgettably, she once commented that she likes to sunbathe naked to “give my vagina a little vitamin D”.</p> <p>Hippy soundbites like that could overshadow the day job, but Woodley is doing just fine, curating a smart mix of lucrative blockbusters and attitudinal independents. Born in the suburbs of Los Angeles, she has acted since she was five, mostly in commercials and on US TV. Her movie break in 2011 came when Alexander Payne cast her in 2011’s <em>The Descendants</em> as George Clooney’s grumpy daughter. There hasn’t been a misstep since. Last year, Woodley starred in the adaptation of John Green’s Young Adult blockbuster <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/22/fault-in-our-stars-review-sugar-coated-teen-weepie\"><em>The Fault in Our Stars</em></a>. She is currently appearing on British screens in the art-house <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/08/white-bird-blizzard-review-weird-wonderful-gregg-araki\"><em>White Bird in a Blizzard</em></a> and the every-house, second instalment of the four-part <em>The Divergent Series</em> franchise, <em>Insurgent</em>. The first, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/06/divergent-review-shailene-woodley-tris-prior\"><em>Divergent</em></a>, released last year, introduced Woodley as Tris, the feisty warrior-heroine at the heart of the story, and made nearly £200m, which is moving towards <em>Hunger Games</em> territory.</p> <p>Woodley takes a seat on the sofa, curls her feet underneath her, like a cat. She wears a chunky Nordic sweater, black leggings and socks; no shoes or any obvious make-up. The pressures of promoting two new films globally are starting to take their toll, so she drinks a herbal blend of echinacea, goldenseal and St John’s wort to keep her immune system ticking over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1732a796c56a3798469c3a2bab343cb480e8ca8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426181334451/5b13f96a-af9a-49ce-87b2-0c1c5d9c7a42-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Shailene Woodley in The Divergent Series: Insurgent\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shailene Woodley as Tris in The Divergent Series: Insurgent: ‘I definitely had my doubts, but having said yes, I wouldn’t change it for the world.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Summit Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>So you make all your own medicines then?</strong><br />Yeah, in a way of sorts, absolutely. I’m a fan of western medicine as well, because if you have something that could be life-threatening, antibiotics save lives every day. But the thing with medicine nowadays is there’s this lack of understanding of our bodies on a deep personal level. If you have a headache or insomnia, it’s so much easier to take a pill for that than to deal with the core problem, which could be a very simple fix.</p> <p><strong>When was the last time you popped a couple of headache pills?</strong><br />Oh, I haven’t taken Advil since I was a kid. It’s probably been close to 10 years.</p> <p><strong>What’s the secret to your toothpaste?</strong><br />It depends on your needs. I like to have clay in there, because it helps detoxify or rid our bodies of heavy metals and radioactive isotopes. It just feels good for my body. Also, I think it’s part of our responsibility to ensure our descendants have water to drink and food to eat from soil that’s been preserved by our caretaking.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/02/insurgent-virtual-reality-truck\">Is Insurgent's Shatter Reality VR ride the future of film?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Is it true you originally said no to the part of Tris in the <em>Divergent</em> films?</strong><br />I did. I was a little trepidatious saying yes to a franchise, simply because I’d just come off a television show [<a href=\"http://abcfamily.go.com/shows/secret-life-american-teenager\"><em>The Secret Life of the American Teenager</em></a>] where I had a six-year contract. So the thought of signing another four-year contract was quite daunting. Also I had said, growing up as a child actor, that I’d never be a part of a big studio franchise, because I never wanted that sort of recognition around the globe. I liked doing smaller roles and I really just love acting because I like being on a movie set and that’s it. So I definitely had my doubts, but having said yes, I wouldn’t change it for the world. </p> <p><strong>Was there something that made you change your mind?</strong><br />I asked advice from a lot of people I respected and ultimately my mom said, “Well, Shai, you’re about to say no to this opportunity because of the budget on the film. If this was an independent film, would you say yes?” And I thought I would say yes, because I love Tris and I do love the storyline and the themes involved within this particular book.</p> <p><strong>Didn’t Jennifer Lawrence tell you, “There are some things – don’t make a sex tape, don’t do drugs, don’t do things in public – that you wouldn’t want other people judging you for. But this is the best decision you’ll ever make”?</strong><br />She was definitely one of the people who gave me some great advice, but I asked lots of different people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX9-l0iO5w4\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sX9-l0iO5w4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>There’s a scene in <em>Insurgent</em> where you appear to do a flying tackle on Kate Winslet. Did that really happen or was it realistic special effects?</strong><br />Yeah, I took her out. Actually, that’s a very interesting shot. That was my stunt double as well as Kate’s stunt double, because insurance wouldn’t let us do it. Those bodies you see are not mine and Kate’s bodies, but they took their faces off and put our faces on. So, there was no harm done to either of us, although we were both game to do it.</p> <p><strong>Did you get bashed up in the shoot at all?</strong><br />You do a little bit. There weren’t any injuries on this movie, but you always want to push it, or at least I always want to push it. Why not? Stunts guarantee safety in a certain manner and you get to have an adrenalised thrill ride without the repercussions of getting hurt. You can get bumped or bruised, but the worst that would happen would be you’d break something. There’s no life-or-death situations.</p> <p><strong><em>Insurgent</em> and <em>White Bird in a Blizzard </em>are very different in scale, themes and budget. Is that how you want your career to be?</strong><br />As an actor you get to try all sorts of different hats on and share hats and own hats and rent hats and give them back. And have them taken from you. And I think that’s wonderful.</p> <p><strong>Are you still able to travel around staying in </strong><a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/\"><strong>Airbnb</strong></a><strong> apartments?</strong><br />Absolutely. I did a trip right after we finished filming <em>Insurgent</em> in Europe, around Spain and Italy, visiting friends and what not.</p> <p><strong>So the fears you had before signing up for the <em>Divergent</em> films haven’t materialised?</strong><br />The fear was loss of anonymity in a way, but I really haven’t lost much of my anonymity. I can still live the life I’ve been living. I’m busier, but I would love to continue exploring and living this nomadic lifestyle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8091edf2bde588bf2388297ec096da7a1bf5d36b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426181623427/5c5728db-8ea1-4325-95aa-55f22f7bd5ce-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Shailene Woodley and Christopher Meloni in White Bird in a Blizzard\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shailene Woodley as Kat Connor in White Bird in a Blizzard, with Christopher Meloni as her downtrodden dad, Brock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Magnolia Pictures/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You didn’t have a mobile phone for almost a year – didn’t you worry that might affect your career somehow?</strong><br />I didn’t have a cellphone after I filmed <em>Divergent</em>. I just realised that a phone wasn’t necessary in my life at that time, so I didn’t have one for a bit. I feel like we place too much importance on ourselves and on people needing to get hold of us. There is a responsibility that you have no matter what job you do to show up for people and to not let people down. But the ways you get from A to B can all be different and varying.</p> <p><strong>After <em>The Descendants</em>, you didn’t work much for a couple of years – were you not advised to capitalise on the success of that film?</strong><br />I didn’t work because I didn’t read anything I particularly loved. The one script I did read and was passionate about was called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/29/sundance-the-spectacular-now-first-look-review\"><em>The Spectacular Now</em></a> and that movie took a year and a half to get made. And I’m in the same position right now. I haven’t read a script that I feel particularly moved by or drawn to. It might be five years until I do another film. A lot of people in this industry work just to simply work, or you’re on a wave so you must ride it. But if you look at it from a place of passion and you go: “Well, if this is meant to be art and if this is something my soul is getting something out of or my right brain is being stimulated by, why would I work to work?” Because then the title goes from being an artist to being a workaholic in a sense.</p> <p><strong>That’s very self-assured...</strong><br />I have the luxury of having been an actor since I was five. So I know that nothing comes overnight and I know that you have to work really hard in order to be successful. I know if I don’t work for five or six years, maybe it will be harder to get a film, but if I’m not booking films, I will bust my ass at acting classes because if it’s something I’m still that passionate about, then why wouldn’t I want to continue to improve my craft? But if I’m being hired simply because my name is a name, that doesn’t feel good. That’s like somebody buying your painting simply because of how much they’re told it’s worth, versus actually enjoying looking at that painting and feeling inspired by it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D1W_aH72-g\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7D1W_aH72-g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>At the end of the year, we’ll see you in </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/03/joseph-gordon-levitt-edward-snowden-nsa-oliver-stone\"><strong>Oliver Stone’s Edward Snowden biopic</strong></a><strong>. </strong>That’s likely to be a controversial film – did you have any hesitation signing up for it?<br />No hesitation whatsoever. It was something I felt was worth fighting for. What I find so compelling about the Snowden situation is that he’s very much in a place where we don’t know what’s going to happen. Will he ever go back to America? Will he stay in Russia? What happens when his asylum ends? There are so many open-ended questions. And being a woman, a young woman in the world today, I am grateful that I have access to information from the files that Edward decided to leak. </p> <p><strong>Has your view of Snowden changed?</strong><br />No, it hasn’t changed at all. Listen, people are quick to say he’s a hero or he’s not a hero. I learned my lesson when I did an interview a few days ago and they changed what I had to say and now <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shailene-woodley-edward-snowden-is-780042\">the headlines are all over the place</a>. But let’s just say that I’m so glad the information he leaked is out there. I feel empowered by it, my life changed because of it, way before this movie was even around. Now, to be a part of this movie is exciting because even though a lot of people know of Edward Snowden, a lot of people don’t know a lot of the facts he released.</p> <p><strong>In the film you play Snowden’s dancer girlfriend </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/edward-snowden-lindsay-mills-guardian\"><strong>Lindsay Mills</strong></a><strong> and part of the preparation has been learning to pole dance.

Horrified at being billeted an officer from the invading army, haughty Madame Angellier (a fearsomely taut Kristin Scott Thomas) and her winsomely hectored daughter-in-law Lucile (Michelle Williams) become the subject of a vicious whispering campaign by the villagers from whom they have extorted high rents for years. In stark contrast to such native hostility, handsome German officer Bruno von Falk (Matthias Schoenaerts) proves a disturbingly charming house guest, playing poignant melodies on Madame Angellier’s lock-and-keyed piano, and discreetly wooing the flustered Lucile about whose soldier-husband little is heard but rumour. Meanwhile, hot-headed Benoît (Sam Riley) treats his landlords as contemptible collaborators as he struggles to keep the Nazis’ hands off his wife and family, a wounded leg doing little to dampen his fiery pro-resistance zeal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/mar/12/suite-francaise-video-review\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/46hqa\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2256967\"                data-video-name=\"Suite Française - video review\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/3/12/1426172000407/crop_KP_119166_640x360.jpeg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-455870476\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/3/12/1426171995953/crop_KP_119166_1200x720.jpeg\"> <source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10140172&amp;format=video/mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/03/12/150312SuiteFrancaiseReview_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/03/12/150312SuiteFrancaiseReview_large.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/03/12/150312SuiteFrancaiseReview.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10140172&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>The now-celebrated origins of <em>Suite Française</em>, which became a publishing sensation in 2004, are as startling and extraordinary as anything on screen – arguably more so. Having fled Paris as the Nazis approached in 1940, the Ukrainian-Jewish writer <a href=\"http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/nemirovsky-irene\">Irène Némirovsky</a> relocated to Issy-l’Evêque in Burgundy, where she began work on a planned five-part tale of war and peace. But after being transported to Auschwitz, Némirovsky died (aged just 39) in 1942, her notebooks entrusted to her daughters Denise and Elisabeth, who believed them to be diaries. It wasn’t until the 1990s that Denise discovered what turned out to be the first two instalments of Némirovsky’s extraordinary unfinished work. Published under the umbrella title <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/mar/04/featuresreviews.guardianreview2\"><em>Suite Française</em></a>, these two self-contained novellas were reportedly optioned by Hollywood’s Universal Pictures. But by 2007 the title had returned to the French ownership of TF1, with whom British co-writer/director Saul Dibb has brought this French/UK/Belgian co-production to the screen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cR0L6invGQ\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4cR0L6invGQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Inventively distilling the essence of its source stories, Dibb and co-writer Matt Charman (whose credits include Spielberg’s forthcoming cold war thriller <em>Bridge of Spies</em>) interpose the Parisian exodus of the first novella, <em>Storm in June, </em>into the rural melodrama of the second, <em>Dolce,</em> to create a satisfyingly rounded yet neatly compact narrative. While the core romantic conceit may be familiar (the “sleeping with the enemy” scenario is a well-worn war-drama staple) the blurred lines and conflicted loyalties with which Dibb and Charman grapple are rewardingly complex and disarmingly compassionate.</p> <p>Although several characters seem at first glance to be trading in generic archetypes, the movie takes pleasure in wrong-footing our expectations, nowhere more so than in the character of Madame Angellier, whose icy surface hides oceans of anxiety and grief (I was reminded of Miranda Richardson’s Miss Lorimer in James Kent’s flawed but heartfelt recent adaptation of<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/18/testament-of-youth-review-tame-adaptation-vera-brittain-book\"> <em>Testament of Youth</em></a>). Indeed, one of the film’s most striking sequences features a moment of life-and-death tenderness between two characters who have previously been tarred as all but irredeemable, supporting players Harriet Walter and Lambert Wilson stealing the movie out from under its stars’ noses with pitch-perfect precision and understatement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ce63c680ab0b9dcc5768763756977f2d7804e99\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/11/1426089608893/5b090ae4-ba56-44ba-820b-c13507373448-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Kristin Scott Thomas as Madame Angellier.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristin Scott Thomas as Madame Angellier.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Amid the sociopolitical intrigues of occupied village life with which the labyrinthine narrative is primarily concerned, the putative love story between Lucile and Bruno can prove the least interesting element. Both Williams and Schoenaerts are talented players, but there’s a peculiar absence to Lucile’s character (unaided by her dreary voiceover) that is at odds with Williams’s sparklingly complex and engaging work in films like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/16/blue-valentine-review-michelle-williams-ryan-gosling\"><em>Blue Valentine</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/17/meeks-cutoff-review\"><em>Meek’s Cutoff</em></a>. Yet even this may be a strength rather than a weakness, reminding us that the problems of these two little people really <em>don’t</em> amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world, pointing us instead towards the tortured heroism of Benoît, the downtrodden defiance of Ruth Wilson’s Madeleine, and the stoical resilience of those who refuse to live “on German time”.</p> <p>Handsomely shot on 35mm by cinematographer Eduard Grau, <em>Suite Française</em> benefits from well-chosen Belgian locations (Marville provides a splendid setting for Bussy’s bustling town square) which add depth, texture, and a tangible sense of history. Production designer Michael Carlin, who was Oscar-nominated for his work on Dibb’s previous feature <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/07/periodandhistorical\"><em>The Duchess</em></a>, continues to prove his worth, creating a world that extends beyond the edge of the frame, a canvas as broad and detailed as the characters themselves. Sensible, too, to have the English-language “French” dialogue delivered without the cod-European accents beloved of Hollywood, Dibb opting instead to utilise the distinctive class inflections of his mother tongue to tease out themes of historical injustice and inequality that existed long before the (German-speaking) Nazis arrive.</p> <p>In its weaker moments, <em>Suite Française </em>tends somewhat toward soft-soapiness, the tinkling piano theme with which Bruno proves his inner spirituality (penned by Alexandre Desplat) merging into Rael Jones’s love-and-war score in ripely sentimental fashion. Yet there are more than enough rough edges in this portrait of a town torn apart to override any melodramatic gloss, and an impressive sense of balance that belies the tumultuous birth of Némirovsky’s handwritten manuscripts, which heartbreakingly accompany the closing credits.</p>","headline":"Suite Française review – rewardingly complex and disarmingly compassionate","trailText":"This handsome adaptation of Irène Némirovsky’s epic novel vividly depicts French rural life under the Nazis","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/11/1426089083713/SUITE-FRANCAISE-001.jpg","wordcount":"841","commentable":"true","starRating":"3","byline":"Mark Kermode, Observer film critic","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-04-05T15:46:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/15/suite-francaise-review-kermode-complex-compassionate","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/mar/15/suite-francaise-review-kermode-complex-compassionate","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/suite-francaise","webTitle":"Suite Française","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/suite-francaise","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/suite-francaise","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/series/mark-kermode-film-of-the-week","webTitle":"Mark Kermode's film of the week","description":"Films of the week reviewed by the Observer's film critic Mark Kermode","type":"series","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/mark-kermode-film-of-the-week","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/series/mark-kermode-film-of-the-week","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/irene-nemirovsky","webTitle":"Irène Némirovsky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/irene-nemirovsky","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/irene-nemirovsky","sectionName":"Books","references":[]},{"id":"film/saul-dibb","webTitle":"Saul Dibb","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/saul-dibb","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/saul-dibb","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/kristin-scott-thomas","webTitle":"Kristin Scott Thomas","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/kristin-scott-thomas","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/kristin-scott-thomas","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/michelle-williams","webTitle":"Michelle Williams","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/michelle-williams","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/michelle-williams","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/sam-riley","webTitle":"Sam Riley","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sam-riley","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/sam-riley","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/markkermode","webTitle":"Mark Kermode","rcsId":"GNL008099","r2ContributorId":"16060","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749336148/MarkKermode.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733743923/MarkKermode.png","firstName":"","lastName":"kermode","twitterHandle":"KermodeMovie","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Writer and broadcaster Mark Kermode is the Observer's chief film critic.

César-nominated Sandrine Kiberlain lends a sly air to this blackly comic Chabrol-esque thriller. When middle-aged pop sensation Vincent Lacroix (Laurent Lafitte) accidentally kills his girlfriend (shades of Noir Désir’s Bertrand Cantat?), he enlists devoted super-fan Muriel (Kiberlain) to help dispose of the body. A divorced beautician who delights in fanciful tales of waxing Klaus Barbie’s daughter’s legs, Muriel sees Vincent’s mission as an adventure – like working for the resistance, with a hint of forbidden romance.

Schlesinger’s 1967 film of Hardy’s novel, ravishingly shot by Nicholas Roeg, is hard to beat","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>With Thomas Vinterberg’s adaptation of Hardy’s classic due in UK cinemas in May, John Schlesinger’s 1967 gem makes a welcome theatrical return in this newly restored version (supervised by cinematographer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/nicolas-roeg\">Nicolas Roeg</a>), which premiered at the last year’s London film festival.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p>

ended, I ended with it’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adapted with reverence and wit by screenwriter Frederic Raphael, the film is splendidly lusty fare, its feet deep in the mud of the English countryside, its head in the lens-flared glare of a dreamy tragi-romantic sky. Even through the soft-focus close-ups, Julie Christie (whose casting was considered controversial) cuts a striking figure as Bathsheba Everdene, variously wooed by Alan Bates’s earthy Gabriel Oak, Peter Finch’s landed William Boldwood and Terence Stamp’s dashingly caddish Sergeant Francis “Frank” Troy. The scene in which a roaring Frank demonstrates his swordsmanship to a gasping Bathsheba remains a masterclass in subversive erotic suggestion – faintly ridiculous, yes, but still quite dazzling.</p> <p>Richard Rodney Bennett earned an Oscar nomination for his score, but it’s Roeg’s photography that seduces and ravishes the viewer; a reverse zoom from a flock of sheep gives us a God’s-eye view of the landscape in a manner that still takes the breath away after nearly 50 years. Vinterberg may be a fine director, but he is going to have a very hard task topping this.</p>","headline":"Far From the Madding Crowd review – still quite dazzling","trailText":"John Schlesinger’s 1967 film of Hardy’s novel, ravishingly shot by Nicholas Roeg, is hard to beat","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2015/3/13/1426264385786/far-from-the-madding-crow-001.jpg","wordcount":"231","commentable":"true","starRating":"4","byline":"Mark Kermode Observer film critic","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-04-15T16:56:00+01:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/15/far-from-the-madding-crowd-1967-john-schlesinger-nicholas-roeg-julie-christie","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/mar/15/far-from-the-madding-crowd-1967-john-schlesinger-nicholas-roeg-julie-christie","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/far-from-the-madding-crowd","webTitle":"Far From the Madding Crowd","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/far-from-the-madding-crowd","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/far-from-the-madding-crowd","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/drama","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/drama","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/markkermode","webTitle":"Mark Kermode","rcsId":"GNL008099","r2ContributorId":"16060","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397749336148/MarkKermode.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733743923/MarkKermode.png","firstName":"","lastName":"kermode","twitterHandle":"KermodeMovie","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Writer and broadcaster Mark Kermode is the Observer's chief film critic.

more than 100 films under his belt, Samuel L Jackson is celebrated as one of Hollywood’s warmest and most intuitive actors.

On the internet, Samuel L Jackson practically sings. “Daaaaaaaaym!!!” he writes. “C’mon y’all!!” he shouts to some 4.5 million followers. “Be da best MUTHAPFUQQAH U CAN BE!!!” He talks constantly in exclamation marks and expletives, made-up words and spellings (someone once worked out that there are more than 57 versions of the word “motherfucker” on his Twitter account). And he commentates soccer games, snaps amusing selfies, socialises with celebrities (in a picture with Mo Farah: “Bad Mufukkah meets Fast Mufukkah!!” On going to see Ed Sheeran in concert: “This MUFFUGGAH is da real deal!!”). He is the chat-show value version of Samuel L Jackson on a daily stream.</p> <p>But the Samuel L Jackson I meet is much more subdued. He is slumped on a sofa, feet resting on a coffee table, in a hotel suite at the Beverly Hills Four Seasons, and can barely summon the will to shake my hand when we are introduced. For the first five minutes of our interview he puffs on an e-cigarette and tosses answers at me like he is dealing cards. At one point, when I am not going fast enough, he interrupts.</p> <p>And he pees. In our 50 minutes together, he disappears unannounced from the suite’s lounge into the bathroom twice for prolonged wees. I don’t know whether to be offended. The first time he does it, we are in the middle of a conversation about Brixton – I had read somewhere that when Jackson arrives in a new city the first thing he does is seek out a “black community”. When we met in early November, Jackson had just made four films in London.</p> <p>I make the error of asking which black community he visited.</p> <p>“Where do you think?” he stares at me. “Come on!” he says.</p> <p>So I locate the nearest area to where I live in southwest London that is famous for its black culture.</p> <p>“Yeah, Brixton,” he says, like I am playing dumb.</p> <p>“Oh cool!” I breeze. “I used to live right next door – in Clapham! For years.”</p> <p>“You used to live near Brixton but not there? Ha!” he laughs. “Why’s that?” And then he swiftly disappears for the pee. But in the distance, bathroom door shut, I hear him grumbling. “You could live in Brixton, you know!” he says. “They wouldn’t mind it!”</p> <p>I feel it would be quite weird to shout something back over the sound of the pee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d91694b83e89cfad5132894c108151b2c96eb31\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/21/1421843824730/b71626d1-95a7-4ded-b654-666fae83ea0c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Samuel L Jackson with his wife LaTanya Richardson and daughter Zoe\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘At times in their marriage she has felt “abandoned” by him’: with wife LaTanya Richardson and daughter Zoe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Brooker/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oh, he’s a funny fish, Samuel L. And I wouldn’t be the first person to say it. His partner of 40 years, the actor <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0724665/\">LaTanya Richardson</a>, once said that the problem with her husband is that he is “emotionally disconnected”. Onscreen he is celebrated for his warmth and wit. But when he is away filming, he apparently can’t even bring himself to say he misses his wife over the phone. Richardson has confessed that at times in their marriage she has felt “abandoned” by him.</p> <p>When I ask him about his lack of affection, Jackson nods. “I have very brief phone conversations. ‘Oh, I miss you!’” he imitates. “No,” he shakes his head. “[We don’t do] that. She’ll say: ‘Oh, I miss you’ and I’ll go: ‘Oh, OK.’’</p> <p>How can you do that?</p> <p>“That’s not good enough?” he asks.</p> <p>Well, it’s not very nice, I say.</p> <p>“So I have to say: ‘I miss you, too?’ I don’t think you should say things expecting a response.”</p> <p>He then enacts a monologue: “‘Oh, I love you! I love you!’” Then in his ladies’ voice: ‘Oh, I love you, too!’ ‘You hang up!’ ‘No, you hang up!’ ‘No, you hang up.’ Psssht. Come on.”</p> <p>So it’s fair to say that when you meet him, Samuel L doesn’t really do niceties. He does not welcome you or say: “Excuse me, I need to go the toilet.” And he does need a bit of ego stroking – after the interview has finished and I listen back, I realise that we don’t really get anywhere until we have talked about his new film. At the mention of <em>Kingsman: The Secret Service</em> – Matthew Vaughn’s comic-book follow-up to <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1250777/\"><em>Kick-Ass</em></a> – he noticeably perks up.</p> <p>“So you’re starring in a very British comic-book film…” I say.</p> <p>“WELL, IN’T IT!” he roars with laughter, like I have delivered some sort of punchline.</p> <p>It’s a grain of sand as far as Jackson’s career is concerned. The highest-grossing actor in the world, he has made more than 100 films (all the more impressive when you consider he got his international breakthrough in <em>Pulp Fiction</em> at 46). He is also the only actor to have commanded anything as huge as a nine- picture deal – at 66 he is on his seventh film of this contract with Marvel, which represents just one part of his oeuvre: playing Nick Fury in comic-book films. That was jammy, I say. “I was just trying to figure out how to stay alive long enough,” he nods, starting to warm up.</p> <p>With all the work from Marvel, he presumably has comic books coming out of his ears. But Jackson says <em>Kingsman</em> (based on an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_%28comics%29\"><em>Icon</em></a> comic) was a slightly different proposition; he wanted to work with Matthew Vaughn. Starring alongside Colin Firth and Michael Caine (he and Caine, who share an agent, socialise together often) was also a draw: “That and the fact that it was sort of comic book meets the spy genre. They take an ordinary kid and turn him into a gentleman spy.”</p> <p>He says he has always wanted to be in a Bond film. “But I don’t think I’ll ever get to be in a Bond film, so I felt like this was an opportunity to play a really great Bond villain.”</p> <p>His character, Valentine, an internet billionaire who styles himself on hip-hop (he wears impeccably cool street wear and serves McDonald’s to house guests from underneath a cloche) was an opportunity to create that villain, he says.</p> <p>How much input did he have, I ask.</p> <p>“We matched a lot of the clothes to the book,” he says. “But we changed all the colours to make ’em specific for different occasions, and added cashmeres and different fabrics, and we had prayer beads made for each outfit…” He begins to go into extraordinary amounts of detail about the clothing. He’s just getting started.</p> <p>So how important is clothing, I ask.</p> <p>“I love clothes. I’m a clothes horse.”</p> <p>In fact, Jackson says, most of the time he has it written into his contract that he can keep the outfits he wears in films.</p> <p>So who is he wearing today? “Armani, Armani, Armani,” he says, dissecting a sea of navy blue – a jumper, hat, trousers. “And these?” he says, holding up his feet. “They’re Adidas. Horse hair.” He even lets me stroke them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3cf4667e10cbf7581a769b34af885345c075be3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/21/1421844163108/02f86fd9-730a-4fdf-bc25-38a1c8c08305-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"On a role: in Die Hard with Bruce Willis\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On a role: in Die Hard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to former colleagues, the small details matter to Jackson. He is what they call meticulous: never late, never forgets a line (pity the reporter who accidentally mistook him for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/26/laurence-fishburne-this-much-i-know\">Laurence Fishburne</a> in a live <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=DCPqElYEuaE\">TV interview last year</a>) and undergoes a process of preparing for each film by writing a “character biography” comprising so many pages it has to be bound.</p> <p>When I ask him about the biographies, Jackson, as he is prone to doing, shrugs me off. So I ask him specifically about Valentine. What was in his biography? “The kind of foods that he eats, educational background, parents, the kind of friends he had, the kind of friends he developed, how he started making money, how he made his money, what he did with it…” It seems an inexhaustible list: “What gives him his confidence, how he’s managed to make his way through the world, especially with the fact that, you know, people…”</p> <p>People, what?</p> <p>“Well,” he pauses. “You know I chose to give him a lisp.”</p> <p>Indeed, it hadn’t gone unnoticed. In the film Valentine’s lisp is used to comic effect. But when I ask why he added the lisp, Jackson says it was because of personal experience. “I did the lisp because people tend to dismiss people who have defects. In interesting sorts of ways. And especially, you know… speech defects.”</p> <p>He gives me his usual shrug. “I stuttered when I was a kid. People laughed at me when I talked. Smart people.”</p> <p>I had read somewhere that this was why he started <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0LBi1MHoaU\">saying motherfucker</a> – to overcome the stutter. He laughs. “It was partly that. But I really just started shutting up. I made such good grades they couldn’t keep up.</p> <p>“But it’s funny. I remember the first time I met Jonathan Ross on TV, and even I was distracted by his speech impediment. I spent more time dealing with that than talking to him. ‘Hi you’re watching the Jonathan Woss show,’” he imitates. “‘Yeah, weawy! Ever had a ’obNob?’”</p> <p>He explains that on <em>Kingsman</em> he worked with the producer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jane-goldman\">Jane Goldman</a> , who is married to Ross. “And it’s something we talked about a lot. We had a lot of discussion about my lisping. You know, the way Valentine would say things. She would say: ‘No he wouldn’t say it that way!’ And I would say: ‘Yes I would.’ So we would go on like that.”</p> <p>Stutterers often start life on the back foot. But this theme seems to run even deeper with Jackson. Raised in Chattanooga in racially segregated Tennessee by his grandparents, he was born to an alcoholic father he met twice and a mother he saw sporadically for the first nine years. An only child, Jackson describes himself as shy and bookish. “I was encouraged to read when I was very small,” he remembers. “I was reading by the time I was three or four years old. I devoured books.”</p> <p>This was, he says, because he wanted to elevate himself through education. But, growing up, he started to develop the stutter. Concerned about his confidence, his aunt, a teacher in Chattanooga, enrolled him in speech therapy and encouraged him to act, casting him in her school plays. Looking back, Jackson says he remembers feeling “loved and encouraged” by his family. “I was very content in terms of that. But I also knew that their desires were as great as mine – you know, for me to get out. Because the only thing I knew growing up was that I was not going to live in that town or place. That was not an option.”</p> <p>He raises a finger. “They just had to make sure I stayed alive <em>to</em> get out.” He laughs. “Because they recognised the rebel in me. They were like: ‘We’d better watch this boy.’”</p> <p>So how did his rebellion manifest itself at such a young age?</p> <p>He shrugs. “Well, I asked a lot of questions. My grandfather was a janitor, so he worked for all these different people who were generally older white men. When I was around, I would answer ’em back.”</p> <p>He stares at me. “I was one of those direct-stare kids. And young black kids,” he says, “that’s just not what you do. You keep your head down. You answer questions. But I was looking into their eyes and the next thing I know, it was: ‘So who are you? What do you do?’ And my grandfather’s like: ‘Fucking shut up!’ But I’d say: ‘What is that? What does that mean?’ And they would say: ‘Boy, you’re asking the questions.’”</p> <p>“But I just wanted to know.

He went to Morehouse in Atlanta – America’s Oxbridge for young black men. To start with, he studied marine biology but switched to architecture then drama and earned himself a reputation for being involved in early battles for racial equality. In 1969 he was charged and convicted for his involvement in a protest in college and suspended for two years. He subsequently got involved with the Black Power movement (he was an usher at Martin Luther King’s funeral), but before long his mother received a visit from the FBI telling her that his life was at risk.</p> <p>She sent him to Los Angeles. Then, after two years of being employed as a social worker, Jackson returned to college. It was here that he met his wife LaTanya, who moved with him to New York in 1976 – both actors found work in off-Broadway plays.</p> <p>But over the next decade, Jackson developed a problem with drugs and alcohol. When I ask him about this period – a time spent drinking bourbon and wine from 8am and smoking weed right through to his performances in the evening – he describes himself as a “functioning alcoholic”.</p> <p>“I enjoyed it,” he shrugs.</p> <p>What kind of drunk were you?</p> <p>“Oh…” he has to think. “Fun? I had a great time. According to most of my friends I was fun. But every now and then I’d get that phone call: ‘I didn’t know you felt that way about me…’”</p> <p>So you were an “I love you” drunk?</p> <p>“No, I’d say: ‘You an asshole!’” he laughs. “‘Fuck you!’ Then I’d have to explain.”</p> <p>In 1990 he went to rehab. The story goes that Richardson and their daughter Zoe, now 31, found Jackson unconscious on the kitchen table. He’s been sober ever since.</p> <p>So what was his last drink?</p> <p>“Tequila,” he remembers instantly, in the way that recovered alcoholics do. “I got smashed at a bachelor party.”</p> <p>Do you miss it?</p> <p>“No. I guess one of my big questions when I got sober was: ‘Am I gonna be fun?’ But yeah, I still am.”</p> <p>Jackson has said that there is a direct correlation between getting clean and his success. Before he quit alcohol, Richardson referred to his acting as “bloodless”. Certainly, he says, his acting improved. But there’s a sense that working has also become his new addiction. With an average of five to six films a year, Jackson has an astonishing output. But at his age and with his success (let alone money), I say, nobody needs to work at the rate he does. Or do they?</p> <p>Jackson smiles. “Painters get up and paint. Writers get up and write. I get up and create characters. I like creating. It fuels me. And it’s doing something that keeps me from being me all day.”</p> <p>If you were you all day, would that be a problem?</p> <p>“It can be a problem, yes. I’d rather be working.”</p> <p>In the last year, he seems to have barely taken a break. And for the most part, he has been in London. “I got there in October 2013,” he says, “did <em>Kingsman</em>. Left for Christmas break. Came back in January, left, did another movie, came back again, did the new <em>Avengers</em>, rolled right into the <em>Tarzan</em> movie.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"062cbedd5c113602f70f74836d896d8c45957e11\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/21/1421844891273/1aecb2c0-fea4-4474-9690-93b207785077-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"I spy: with Colin Firth in the upcoming Kingsman: The Secret Service.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I spy: with Colin Firth in the upcoming Kingsman: The Secret Service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaap Buitendijk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does he enjoy working away?</p> <p>“Ah, I go in and out. That’s the way it works.”</p> <p>And he meets people for dinner anyway. “When I was in London recently, I had dinner with Maggie Smith and Michael Caine. I played a lot of golf…”</p> <p>Who does he play in the UK?</p> <p>“Chatty Man’s pretty good actually,” he laughs, referring to Alan Carr. “We even played Dunhill one year.”</p> <p>He’ll continue to play golf now that he’s back in LA (working near a golf course is another clause in his film contracts, along with an electric massage chair), but he misses people, he says. “It wasn’t until I got back here last week and I was driving around that I realised I saw more people in one day in London than in a week in Los Angeles.”</p> <p>It’s just as well, then, that he’s so busy. Tomorrow he will go to a read-through for his next project, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3460252/\"><em>The</em> <em>Hateful Eight</em></a> – a new film from Quentin Tarantino – in LA.</p> <p>“It’s gonna be fuuuuun!” he says. “Well, actually, it’s going to be mean. It’s eight very mean people with eight guns.”</p> <p>How does feel about reuniting with Tarantino?</p> <p>“Excited! Always.” He flaps a hand. “We talk all the time.”</p> <p>And, of course, there are more projects. “I tend to insist to my agents that I know the next three movies I’m doing ahead of time.”</p> <p>Blimey, I say. Do you drive your agents insane?</p> <p>“Yes I do!” he says proudly. “It’s a lot of pressure finding a job for me.”</p> <p>But whatever scripts he is given, he says, he will usually find one. “They just give me a bunch of stuff and I’ll pick one and say: ‘Negotiate this deal.’ You know, we make things work. If it’s a good story, I might say: ‘They want me to play this guy. I don’t like that guy. I like <em>that</em> guy. Can I be that guy?’ And they’ll find out.”</p> <p>“And then,” he adds, “at other times when a movie comes along, it might be a movie I wanted to see as a kid. So with <em>Tarzan</em>, I always wanted to be in that movie. Here’s the chance. Hell yeah! Let me be in that.”</p> <p>He smiles. “It’s still the thing that drives me. I’m still doing the movies I was pretending to do as a kid.”</p> <p>He did go to the movies a hell of a lot – according to what I’ve read, he’d spend the whole day there on his own. Did he ever get lonely? It seems to be the common complaint of an only child.</p> <p>“No, not at all,” says Jackson. “You know, at a certain point, it was time for friends to go home. I lived in a neighbourhood of kids. But there was a time of day when I needed to stop and go read my book. Go into my head world. I didn’t want to run and jump and hear them make noise any more.”</p> <p>Later, when Jackson’s publicist comes into the room to say we’ve got a final five minutes, this soundbite rings back through my head. “Oh, she’s done!” Jackson shouts, getting up. So I let him go for his quiet time.</p> <p>Kingsman: The Secret Service<em> is released on 29 January</em></p>","headline":"Samuel L Jackson: ‘I create characters – it keeps me from being me all day’","trailText":"With more than 100 films under his belt, Samuel L Jackson is celebrated as one of Hollywood’s warmest and most intuitive actors.

They would be wrong.</p> <p>The scene with the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0959963/awards\">award-winning </a>Icelandic-American actor, which features in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTKBowDjMQg\"><em>A Walk Among the Tombstones,</em> starring Liam Neeson</a>, was made possible because he was attached to a crane, harness and rigging, all of which were then erased from the footage.</p> <p>The equipment had been repeatedly tested, first with heavy bags. Even so, few of us would be likely to attempt it ourselves.</p> <p>Stunt performers are increasingly working with the industry’s visual effects wizards now that more spectacular actions can be performed with safety equipment that can later be blotted out for the audience.</p> <p>Ólafsson’s stunt was organised by Mark Vanselow, a leading stuntman and coordinator, who has worked on 16 films with Neeson, the Oscar-nominated star of <em>Schindler’s List</em>, as well as on Hollywood blockbusters such as <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>.</p> <p>Vanselow said that it is now possible to stage stunts that were previously regarded as impossible, and actors can increasingly perform their own stunts, which makes the action seem more realistic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-298d19ea-dddf-4c86-8007-25c2aa8a27fc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/17/1421538090549/40a65a9f-156f-4a9e-9eae-d095d0bd6904-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sandra Bullock gravity stunt special eddefct\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandra Bullock in the rig, which was later digitally removed, in Gravity.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only a few years ago, he said, stunt specialists had grimly resigned themselves “to start looking for another job” because they feared that computer effects were becoming so sophisticated. They could not have been more wrong: “It actually helps us,” said Vanselow. “The computer is breathing new life into the profession.”</p> <p>Ólafsson plays a cemetery groundskeeper alongside Neeson’s character, a private investigator hired by a drug-trafficker to find out who murdered his wife.</p> <p>“I’m afraid of heights,” he said. “That was a challenge to overcome.” He credited Vanselow and his team with helping him to face it: “They tested it again and again. Mark was very careful to make sure I wasn’t being pushed.”</p> <p>Everything went into slow motion, he remembers. Just watching that scene is “scary”. Even with the safety equipment, a passerby screamed as he jumped – and can be heard in the film.</p> <p>“That’s a great example of how the special effects help us,” said Vanselow. “The audience gets to see the actual character doing the stunt – and the actor gets to go home at night. It’s not an easy thing to just jump off a building … You put a lot of trust in us.”</p> <p>Vanselow began his career as a water-skier, performing “circus on water” shows worldwide. Being a stuntman means doing “things that are fun”, he said, “like hanging under a helicopter”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83a445c666be420655d2b5d5a2aec8d19b6c27c1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/17/1421538486637/65e3d30c-07bd-454f-bc68-d89f4339c023-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Vanselow stuntman\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Vanselow, a stuntman and stunt co-ordinator who has worked on 16 films with Liam Neeson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In another Neeson film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYigQFLZmY\"><em>Seraphim Falls</em></a>, Vanselow went over a 34-metre waterfall, dropped from underneath a helicopter. “That was one of the biggest stunts I’ve done. They dropped me over the edge on a bungee rope and I disappeared into the water and popped back up.</p> <p>“I was able to do it that way because they could [blot out] the line that was holding me, whereas 20 years ago I would have had to go over without a line. They may not have been able to do that stunt at all.”</p> <p>It does, however, remain a dangerous profession. “About 99% of the time, you’re overpaid,” said Vanselow. “But then that 1% … There’s not enough money in the world. If you’re jumping off a building and something goes desperately wrong, you’re the person at the end of the wire.”</p> <p>Tim Webber, the British visual effects specialist who won an Oscar for <em>Gravity</em>, the space disaster film starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, said of Vanselow: “He’s absolutely right, judging from the amount of work we do these days that involves stuntmen, and how much I work with [them to design stunts], I’ve worked closely with stuntmen a lot more, recently.”</p> <p>Basing special effects on real action also makes a film more believable, he said. “Once you create computer-generated characters that can do absolutely anything, it loses any ‘wow factor’.”</p> <p>Vanselow said the technology is now so sophisticated that where a stunt performer has to be used they can superimpose an actor’s face over the stunt specialist’s, allowing full close-up shots.</p> <p>Andrew Lane, author of <em>Movie Stunts &amp; Special Effects</em>, said: “But a performer is always needed to form the basis of visual creations in a computer.”</p> <p><em>A Walk Among the Tombstones is released on Blu-ray and DVD on 19 January</em></p>","headline":"Digital

release caps an interesting 18 months for black cinema, a period when filmmakers got back to telling complex, honest and unflinching stories about life in America</p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>As reports pour in about the shooting of yet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2014/dec/24/black-teenager-shot-dead-by-police-in-st-louis-live-updates\">another black teenager in St Louis</a>, I was reminded of what filmmaker Ava DuVernay said a few weeks ago: “This aggression is ambient, it’s all-around, and it’s the atmosphere of people of color in this country”.</p> <p>DuVernay said these words while promoting her latest film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6t7vVTxaic\">Selma</a>, which opens tomorrow. It’s a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/05/selma-review-civil-rights-drama\">gorgeous and brave film</a> that tells the story of the 1965 marches from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2014/dec/17/1965-selma-montgomery-march-stephen-somerstein\">Selma to Montgomery</a>, led by Dr Martin Luther King Jr.</p> <p>When DuVernay began filming Selma this year, she could not have predicted that in August, a young unarmed black man named <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting\">Michael Brown would be shot </a>by police in Ferguson, Missouri. She could not have predicted that a grand jury would decide not to indict police officers in the death of not just Mike Brown, but also in the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner\">Eric Garner</a>. </p> <p>And yet, Selma lands perfectly in sync with the unrest that has characterized the last few months for black America. By grounding the film in the conversations being had in America in 2014, Selma succeeds in transcending the historical drama cateogory – it’s as contemporary as ever, and as real and familiar as it could be. </p> <p>There’s a scene in the film where Martin Luther King, played by David Oyelowo, speaks to his congregation after a young black man has been shot. His fury rises as he wonders: “how many fingers were on that trigger? Every white preacher who stands silent. Every Negro who stands back.” The conversation about the silence of white Americans about racial injustice is one that is most likely taking place right now, and with nearly the same language.</p> <p>DuVernay isn’t the only black director making brave, forward-thinking cinema. She is among the leaders of a new school of black filmmakers who are creating new contemporary narratives for the black experience. DuVernay made history by becoming the first black woman to be nominated for best director at the Golden Globes; Selma is up for best picture.</p> <p>Also at the forefront of this movement are Justin Simien, the writer and director of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uag2G0J6iqw\">Dear White People</a>; Ryan Coogler, whose 2013 directorial debut, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxUJwJfcQaQ\">Fruitvale Station</a>, took home the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance; Beyond The Lights director Gina Prince-Bythewood, and, of course, British artist-turned-director Steve McQueen, whose third feature film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z02Ie8wKKRg\">12 Years A Slave</a>, won the Oscar for best picture this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b004b3243456235fd9dfcc95313f9bf12b5ac073\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b004b3243456235fd9dfcc95313f9bf12b5ac073/0_51_2712_1627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Selma\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Oyelowo, center, as Martin Luther King Jr and Carmen Ejogo, right, as Coretta Scott King in Selma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atsushi Nishijima/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simien’s film satirically explores crises in modern blackness, while Coogler’s Fruitvale Station chronicles the events that led to the death of Oscar Grant, a young black man from Oakland. McQueen’s film, 12 Years A Slave, brought slavery to audiences in brutal realism rarely seen on the screen.</p> <p>These directors are reimagining possibilities not just for black filmmakers, but for new stories to be told about the black experience – and audiences are interested. Fruitvale Station was made for the paltry sum of $900,000 and so far has made more than $17m. Simien described Dear White People’s budget as “real low”, and said that film is approaching $4.5m at the box office. And 12 Years A Slave has banked more than $185m on a $22m budget. With Oscar buzz building around Selma, it’s easy to imagine the film being equally successful.</p> <p>The encouraging reaction has spurred interest from studios in making more black films. McQueen has announced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/18/steve-mcqueen-to-make-film-about-paul-robeson\">his next project will be about the singer Paul Robeson</a>, the civil rights activist, singer and actor. Meanwhile, Coogler’s <a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-followup-creed-building-cast-shoot-dates-eyed-20141111\">next film will be entitled Creed,</a> and is a spinoff of the Rocky films centering on the grandson of Apollo Creed, the black boxer whom Rocky beats to become champion. </p> <p>These filmmakers are making markedly different films than the projects Hollywood was interested in just 5 years ago. Only Lee Daniels’ Precious warranted any attention from the Oscars. That film received a great deal of criticism for telling a one-dimensional story of the black experience: poor, downtrodden and gratuitously hopeless. It’s a story that targets a specific audience. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/17/AR2009111703465.html?nav=rss_email/components&amp;sid=ST2009111703607\">Courtland Milloy criticized</a> the exaggerated story of black life portrayed in Precious: “When human pathology is given a black face, white people don’t have to feel so bad about their own.”</p> <p>Fast forward to 2014 and one of the year’s most significant releases is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/top-five-review-chris-rock-toronto-movie\">Chris Rock’s comedy Top Five</a>. The central theme of that film is the rejection of singular, dominant narratives. Chris Rock’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/17/chris-rock-the-top-five-moments-from-his-top-five-promo-tour\">promotion of the film</a>, has sparked interesting conversations about new realities of race and racism in the US. There is a great deal to dissect about race relations today, and grounding these films in the contemporary black experience stands in contrast to films that Hollywood usually hungers for.</p> <p>There was a serious lull in black films about contemporary experience, but with directors such as DuVernay, Simien, Coogler and McQueen, it seems we’ve entered a new and promising era where stories about blackness are told by artists who are as concerned with the storytelling as they are with how their work will resonate with those who have lived the black experience in America. That is no small thing.</p>","headline":"2014: the year that black cinema bounced back in America","trailText":"Selma’s release caps an interesting 18 months for black cinema, a period when filmmakers got back to to telling complex, honest and unflinching stories about life in America","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/24/1419432229274/34380444-bf4b-4078-af43-c0a0a6f607d5-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"865","commentable":"true","byline":"Elamin Abdelmahmoud","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-28T13:00:12Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/25/2014-the-year-that-black-cinema-bounced-back-in-america","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/dec/25/2014-the-year-that-black-cinema-bounced-back-in-america","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/selma","webTitle":"Selma","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/selma","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/selma","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/12-years-a-slave","webTitle":"12 Years A Slave","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/12-years-a-slave","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/12-years-a-slave","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/fruitvale-station","webTitle":"Fruitvale Station","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/fruitvale-station","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/fruitvale-station","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/martin-luther-king","webTitle":"Martin Luther King","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/martin-luther-king","sectionName":"US news","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/oscars","webTitle":"Oscars","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/oscars","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/golden-globes","webTitle":"Golden Globes","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/golden-globes","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/golden-globes","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/top-five","webTitle":"Top Five","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/top-five","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/top-five","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"world/race","webTitle":"Race issues","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/race","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/race","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/analysis","webTitle":"Analysis","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/analysis","references":[]},{"id":"profile/elamin-abdelmahmoud","webTitle":"Elamin Abdelmahmoud","r2ContributorId":"66761","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/23/1414072350219/Elamin-Abdelmahmoud.jpg","firstName":"elamin","lastName":"abdelmahmoud","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Elamin Abdelmahmoud is a Canadian writer and journalist living in Toronto.

guru’ who inspired hit US show Scandal is hired by embattled film-maker as North Korea denies hacking","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>A Washington fixer who inspired the lead character in television show <em>Scandal</em> has been hired to get a grip of Sony Pictures’ communications after the computer hack that exposed its secrets and sparked a bizarre showdown with North Korea.</p> <p>Judy Smith, “the real Olivia Pope” who worked in the George HW Bush White House and has advised celebrity clients from Monica Lewinsky to Wesley Snipes, has the task of restoring the company’s reputation after a week when it has been accused – even by President Barack Obama – of caving in to blackmail and threats of violence.</p> <p>The low point for Sony in the month-long nightmare of drip-fed personal revelations came last Wednesday when executives announced they were cancelling the Christmas Day release of <em>The Interview</em>, the comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco that depicts an assassination of North Korea dictator Kim Jong-un.</p> <p>Sony said it was not releasing the film in any form, because leading cinema chains had been scared by threats of 9/11-style violence. That sparked a backlash in which celebrities, politicians and commentators accused Sony of letting terrorists win.</p> <p>Criticism mounted as the FBI accused North Korea of being behind the hack attack. In his end-of-year news conference last Friday, Obama said he thought Sony had made a mistake: “We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States.” He vowed to retaliate against North Korea at a time and in a manner of his administration’s choosing.</p> <p>Sony’s PR counter-offensive, no doubt influenced by Smith, began hours later. The company blamed the cancelled release on cinema owners. “That was their decision,” a statement said. British-born chief executive Michael Lynton said that, despite scrapping the Christmas release, he was hopeful the film could be released at some point.</p> <p>“The president, the press and the public are mistaken on what actually happened,” he said. “We have not caved, we have not given in, we have persevered, and we have not backed down.”</p> <p>Insiders said Sony appeared to be shifting its position while giving as strong an impression as possible that it had adopted the same line all along.</p> <p>One possible reason for announcing on Wednesday that the film had been scrapped was to make an insurance claim, based on a terrorist threat, to recoup $80m in production and marketing costs. Plans for a partial or future release could invalidate that claim, one intellectual property rights lawyer familiar with big studio practices told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>By Friday, however, the company had clearly decided that insurance claims were the least of its worries. It is not known when Smith came on board, but Sony has been without a PR chief since Charles Sipkins was fired days before the 24 November computer hack.</p> <p>Criticism has grown, led by actors in an eerie echo of the plotline of <em>Team America: World Police</em>, another Hollywood comedy featuring a North Korean dictator and also a large cast of string-puppet film stars. George Clooney told one Hollywood website, Deadline.com, that he had circulated a petition supporting a cinema release for <em>The Interview</em>, but nobody dared sign it. Sean Penn, known for his strong political opinions, said the way was now clear for other acts of international extortion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f8c713aac6eeeddeef1c53fece5cff103818c7c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/20/1419101497246/5eb66bb1-d288-42a2-a17b-db5982591da6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A still from the trailer for The Interview which is said to have offended North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the trailer for The Interview which is said to have offended North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal News And Sport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The distributors who wouldn’t show <em>The Interview</em> and Sony have sent Isis a commanding invitation,” Penn said. “Pandora’s box is officially open.”</p> <p>North Korea consistently denied any involvement in the Sony hack, but has now offered to help find “whoever” was responsible – using the occasion to attack the US.</p> <p>“As the United States is spreading groundless allegations and slandering us, we propose a joint investigation with it into this incident,” a foreign ministry spokesman said. “Without resorting to such tortures as were used by the CIA, we have means to prove that this incident has nothing to do with us.”</p> <p>Obama said his administration would respond “proportionally” as senior officials <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/world/asia/us-asks-china-to-help-rein-in-korean-hackers.html?emc=edit_na_20141220&amp;nlid=70059035&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">told the <em>New York Times </em>they had sought China’s help in recent days</a> to block North Korea’s ability to launch cyber attacks. China, whose cooperation would be critical since virtually all of North Korea’s telecommunications run through Chinese-operated networks, is yet to respond.</p> <p>The furore appeared to overshadow a second statement in which Pyongyang vowed to boost its nuclear capability and resist a UN resolution, passed on Thursday, to refer its leaders to the international criminal court for crimes against humanity.</p>","headline":"Sony calls in celebrity spin doctor to limit fallout from The Interview","trailText":"‘Crisis guru’ who inspired hit US show Scandal is hired by embattled film-maker as

Not to mention her soft spot for the BBC. “I love the BBC,” said Lohan. “I haven’t heard myself mentioned on TV since I have been here. That has been really weird for me, and great.”</p> <p>Lohan, who has lived in the capital for nine months, has a lease for another year on her flat in the West End and is currently planning to make it her permanent residence. “I won’t live in LA again, hell no. My friends tell me shit when they come over I don’t want to hear,” said Lohan. “I don’t even know who got married and who got pregnant. You turn on the news in LA and it is all gossip about people. All the stuff that is going on in the world right now and this gossip is the news? I can go for a run here [London] on my own ... I do every morning, early, and I think how my friends in New York would still be up partying at that time. I needed to grow up and London is a better place for me to do that than anywhere else. In LA I didn’t know what to do, apart from go out every night. That’s when my friends were free. And I would go out and there would be all these cameras there and that’s when it became difficult.”</p> <p>Lohan, who recently starred in the West End play <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/05/speed-the-plow-lindsay-lohan-review-playhouse-london-schiff-lindsay-posner\" title=\"\"><em>Speed-the-Plow</em></a>, decided to turn her back on the west coast while holidaying alone in Greece over the summer. It was the first time she had ever been on holiday by herself. “I just wandered about on my own! I turned my phone off. It was so extraordinarily freeing for me. Like another life.”</p> <p>She credits the turnaround in her life, in part, to Oprah Winfrey. Winfrey provided Lohan with the self-help book <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/untethered-soul.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Untethered Soul</em></a> by Michael Singer, and it has since become Lohan’s “bible”, guiding her away from the destructive voice in her head. “There’s a chapter called ‘The Rose and the Thorn’, you sit on a couch and you imagine that voice in your head as a person next to you. You learn how to distance yourself from that person.”</p> <p>The second stage of her transformation, according to the interview, was learning to be punctual – now she is determined not to miss any appointments, especially when it comes to her stage work in London.</p> <p>“One time I was sick with a bug. I had been vomiting all day, but no way was I going to miss a show. I was sitting there beforehand seeing spots in front of my eyes. I had a plan: if I felt sick on stage I was going to faint, play dead, pretend it was part of the script. Didn’t happen, fortunately.”</p>","headline":"Lindsay Lohan: why I want to make London my home","trailText":"Actor talks about her love affair with the capital, the BBC and why Oprah Winfrey is responsible for the turnaround in her life<br /><br /><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/13/lindsay-lohan-interview-london-stage-debut\" title=\"\">• Lindsay Lohan interview: ‘I needed to grow up’</a>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/14/1418549321890/Lindsay-Lohan-in-Speed-th-006.jpg","wordcount":"527","commentable":"false","byline":"Ashley Cowburn","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-17T09:33:35Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/14/lindsay-lohan-london-bbc-oprah-winfrey","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/dec/14/lindsay-lohan-london-bbc-oprah-winfrey","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/lindsay-lohan","webTitle":"Lindsay Lohan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/lindsay-lohan","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/lindsay-lohan","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/interview","webTitle":"Interviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/interview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/interview","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ashley-cowburn","webTitle":"Ashley Cowburn","r2ContributorId":"53899","firstName":"ashley","lastName":"cowburn","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ashley Cowburn is a political reporter at The Observer and winner of the Anthony Howard Award 2014.

The pluses are mainly monetary – I can help friends and family. To be able to say to a friend who’s in trouble: “Don’t worry, I can pay your rent” is a privilege.</p> <p><strong>I never had the shock </strong>of losing all my privacy. I started in showbiz at 11 months old and it’s always been my reality.</p> <p><strong>My mother’s alcoholism</strong> kept me on the straight and narrow throughout my childhood and teen years. I was a caretaker to a drinker. I didn’t have time to consider going off the rails myself – all I wanted to do was to get A’s in school and keep my mum alive.</p> <p><strong>I didn’t understand the furore </strong>around <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Baby_%281978_film%29\"><em>Pretty Baby</em></a> [in which Shields played a prostitute, age 11]. My mum was furious. I remember her saying: “Did you like what you did?” I said yes, so she said: “Then fuck ’em if they can’t handle it.”</p> <p><strong>Michael Jackson and I were very close. </strong>He was the first to get in touch when my dad got sick and the first there when he died. We went through a lot together, but I’ll always remember how we laughed. I was devastated when he died. I felt like a zombie.</p> <p><strong>I was ready to go down in a ball of flames</strong> to become a mother. It took seven rounds of IVF to get pregnant with my daughter Rowan. It made me a crazy person – I was so focused on having a child that I couldn’t see anything else. Totally selfish, but I needed to create a family for my own sanity.</p> <p><strong>Children have the sharpest instincts. </strong>They tend to be wary of adults they don’t feel comfortable with. I can tell whether someone is genuine immediately and I’ve been able to do that from a very young age – I was like a little shark sensing blood in the water.</p> <p><strong>Cannes Festival in 1978 </strong>was one of the worst experiences of my life. <em>Pretty Baby</em> was nominated for the Palme d’Or and I remember being terrified, caught in a huge crowd, a pair of scissors appearing from the corner of my eye as a fan tried to cut my hair off. I’d never experienced that sort of vicious adoration.</p> <p><strong>Postpartum depression</strong> is the hardest thing I’ve had to get through. It still colours the dynamic I have with my daughter. I feel residual guilt. At the time Tom Cruise criticised my use of antidepressants and therapy very publicly. The one thing I can thank him for is that it raised awareness of the illness.</p> <p><strong>I’m a New Yorker through and through.</strong> It’s where I grew up and where I live now. That meant I wasn’t constantly with people in the entertainment industry – I had a proper foundation, surrounded by my father’s family. It’s probably the reason I’m relatively sane today.</p> <p><strong>I no longer talk to my ex-husband</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/08/open-autobiography-andre-agassi\">Andre Agassi</a>. The last time we had an exchange he asked me to look at his book and change the bits involving me according to what the truth was. He ignored me anyway and made it look like I’d sanctioned his version. There’s no anger, but he had the opportunity to reach out when my mother died [in 2012], and he didn’t.</p> <p><strong>I’m scared of having unrealised potential</strong>. I don’t feel I’ve done enough. Let’s face it, the acting in <em>The Blue Lagoon</em> wasn’t exactly great.</p> <p>There was a Little Girl: The Real Story of My Mother and Me,<em> by Brooke Shields, is out now,</em> <em>priced

Talya Lavie was inspired by her own time in the Israeli Defense Force and paints a picture of day-dreaming, gender politics and high heels</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>If you show a staple gun in the first act it has to go off in the third. But that’s about the only dramatic principle to which the characters in Zero Motivation adhere. Normally that would be a problem, seeing as how this film is set in the army, but it’s not like we’re on the battle lines. Writer-director Talya Lavie drew from her own personal experience in the Israeli Defense Forces, setting her first feature in the dullest administrative office in a remote desert base. The elevator pitch “Girls meets M*A*S*H” may seem a tad reductive, but it’s apt. The angst is the same though the specifics, and urgency, has changed.</p> <p>The Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge of Paper and Shredding, Daffi (Nelly Tagar), has devoted her life’s efforts toward one goal: to transfer her compulsory military service to a base in Tel Aviv. Visions of walking amid gleaming towers in high heels are the only thing keeping her alive. This potential abandonment causes some stress for her pal Zohar (Dana Ivgy), a coarse and slightly unkempt fellow secretary/soldier whose sole job, it would seem, is playing Minesweeper on an outdated computer. Zohar is a Yossarian-esque rascal, the only one who can see that everyone else at the base is nuts. If Daffi goes, Zohar will be left alone with the twin ditzes who sing pop songs and twirl their gum, a brusque Russian immigrant who makes fatalist remarks in a voice so low certain dogs couldn’t hear it and the by-the-book commander whose twin passions are paperwork and brown-nosing. It’s a textbook case of an individual mortified by dense authority. If Bill Murray were a twenty-something Israeli woman, he’d be Dana Igvy as the disheveled kibbutznik in Zero Motivation.</p> <p>The bulk of the film plays out in episodic form (indeed, it is segmented in three chapters) but this sitcom-like setup serves a purpose. Characters weave in and out. Someone that seems key will drift away as someone that seemed merely a gag takes center stage for a while. This approach works well to underscore the feeling of a life in which unseen and inexplicable forces are in control. In time, Zohar’s brusk exterior reveals an inner timidity beneath her khaki parka. She’s actually a virgin, likely the only one on the base, and if dating weren’t difficult enough these days try working that out as a new platoon of handsome paratroopers bunk down for just a few nights.</p> <p>The comedy in Zero Motivation ranges from wordplay to visual gags to some “saw that coming down Broadway” moments of comeuppance. There is, however, an undercurrent of sadness, particularly with Rama (Shani Klein) the group leader. Clearly she’s the foil – she keeps a framed photo of Margaret Thatcher on her wall – but it’s not her fault her battalion of paper filers are the Bad News Bears of the Israeli desert, and the way in which the male officers disregard her smacks of unspoken sexism. She’s passed over for a promotion for another woman, but are any men in her position asked to serve coffee?</p> <p>There are no references to Hamas or Palestinians or Arabs or anything else connoting the unending conflict in the Middle East. Yet our bumbling leads are reminded time and again that “we are at war” and “our soldiers are dying”. The only nod to headlines or history is a shot of a woman stapling up posters commemorating Israel’s numerous conflicts from 1948 through to our current decade. The degree to which real danger and bloodshed is ignored in Zero Motivation adds a strange urgency what could otherwise be an Office Space-like lark. When the movie does take some dark turns, it’s almost a relief.</p> <p>There are some whose politics have no room for a film like this. “This is not a laughing matter”, they’ll say. This attitude negates reality, and perhaps negates storytelling in general. Zero Motivation is a shot of honesty, in which short-term goals are far more important than larger geo-political ones. Perhaps because they are the only ones over which we have any control.</p>","headline":"Zero Motivation review – an off-kilter look at female soldiers in the IDF","trailText":"Writer-director Talya Lavie was inspired by her own time in the Israeli Defense Force and paints a picture of day-dreaming, gender politics and high heels","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/5/1417794874505/e4dffb95-3be7-4ea5-ac10-adb077463610-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"682","commentable":"true","starRating":"4","byline":"Jordan Hoffman","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-08T11:30:00-05:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/05/zero-motivation-review-female-soldiers-idf","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/dec/05/zero-motivation-review-female-soldiers-idf","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"world/israel","webTitle":"Israel","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/israel","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jordan-hoffman","webTitle":"Jordan Hoffman","r2ContributorId":"64308","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/23/1403542588719/Jordan-Hoffman-profile-pi-003.jpg","firstName":"jordan","lastName":"hoffman","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jordan Hoffman is a writer and critic based in New York City.

I sometimes hear a voice and think: “That could be a character I could do.” Of course there are many different grades, right up to the autism spectrum, and I am nowhere near that. But I sympathise with children who have it.</p> <p><strong>As I’ve grown older </strong>I’ve become less focused on show business. I am no longer writing and pitching scripts. I am much more picky about the movies I do. In the 80s and 90s I was away from my family a lot, so I am trying to make up for that by spending time with them now.</p> <p><strong>I don’t draw inspiration from my childhood. </strong>There are guys like Jim Carrey who had a miserable youth and created incredible comedy from that. But I had a great childhood in Ottawa, Canada.</p> <p><strong>James Brown showed me </strong>the responsibilities of being a band leader, with the rest of your group relying on you to keep the pay cheques coming in. Even if he was feeling down he didn’t let it affect his performance.</p> <p><strong>There is a universal life force that connects us all.</strong> I believe in an overhead cosmic godhead, a power that I draw on. But a church doesn’t have to be a church, it can just be one or more people in a room.</p> <p><strong>The death of John Belushi hit me hard. </strong>We had so much going on: a hit movie, a TV series. Suddenly I lost my partner. For a while afterwards I thought I might not come back from that.</p> <p><strong>Comedians today are more thoughtful than we were,</strong> and more grounded in real life. We did more absurdist stuff. But I love the younger guys – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jonah-hill\">Jonah Hill</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/willferrell\">Will Ferrell</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/melissa-mccarthy\">Melissa McCarthy</a>. The torch has been passed.</p> <p><strong>I think of myself as a capitalist-socialist. </strong>I’m not very political, but if you had to take my leanings I’m left of centre. After Hurricane Katrina a lot of money was sucked away and never went to the rural police departments. My charity [the <a href=\"http://bluelineusa.org/\">Blue Line Foundation</a>] provides equipment and training – if you provide a car or a vest, you are tangibly making a difference.</p> <p><strong>My Harley-Davidson is a form of psychiatric therapy. </strong>You get on that and you don’t need a shrink. When you’re on the bike all you’re doing is concentrating on staying alive. You get into the rhythm of the road and it’s quite zen.</p> <p><strong>I’m a big fan of the British monarchy.</strong> I am lucky to have met the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward – they’re a living link with history. I look at Prince William and see a young guy with his heart and soul in the right place.</p> <p><strong>I believe in the continuous consciousness of the soul: </strong>when you die it goes off on a journey and becomes something else. You can draw on the power of those who have gone before – they will inspire and help you.</p> <p><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/17/get-on-up-james-brown-chadwick-boseman\">Get On Up</a><em> is in cinemas now</em></p>","headline":"Dan Aykroyd: ‘My Harley-Davidson is a form of psychiatric therapy.

of Mr Turner says family rows provided a lifetime of dramatic material","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Film director Mike Leigh is to talk for the first time about the impact of childhood conflict on his art and the decision by his father to send him to a child psychiatrist.</p> <p>Speaking to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/alan-yentob\" title=\"link to Alan Yentob profile\">Alan Yentob</a> in a new and unprecedentedly personal interview for BBC1’s <em>Imagine</em>, the director of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/mr-turner\" title=\"link to  Guardian stories\">the acclaimed new film <em>Mr Turner</em></a> and the creator of many celebrated British comedies, including <em>Abigail’s Party</em>, <em>Life is Sweet</em> and <em>Happy Go Lucky</em>, will reveal the “awful, terrible” family “screaming matches” that were the chief characteristic of his home life as a boy in Salford. The high level of discord, he suggests, has provided him with dramatic material ever since.</p> <p>Leigh, 71, tells Yentob that his father, Dr Abe Leigh, was deeply opposed to the idea that he might become an artist or an actor. He forbade him his frequent habit of sketching visitors to the house and regarded him as a problem child because of his creative interests.</p> <p>“I was always drawing caricatures of people and he asked me to stop because he thought it might offend them,” Leigh will say. “Even the word ‘artist’ was very frightening to him, anathema. So the idea that I would be any sort of artist was terrifying to him”</p> <p>At the age of 14 Leigh was taken to see an NHS psychiatrist. “He [his father] decided I had something wrong with me mentally. So I went to see this extremely nice guy. And these were the first adult conversations I had had with another adult.”</p> <p>The psychiatrist told Leigh’s father that there was no mental problem with his son, but the news was not welcomed. “He said, ‘There is nothing wrong with him. He just doesn’t like being at home.’ My father was very angry and stopped me going. So I used to go along on my own to see him, and when my father found out about that he threatened to have him struck off the register.”</p> <p>The film director also recalls that both his parents were concerned about social appearances and about doing “the done thing”. The family moved from a working-class area of Salford out into the suburbs and their desire to conform became the centre of conflict. “I remember life at home becoming a battlefield every night,” Leigh says. “There were rows about nothing really. And what Dr Leigh was really doing, of course, was giving me a lifetime’s ammunition for my film-making. But the screaming matches were awful, terrible, horrifying to remember.”</p> <p>When the teenage Leigh, who went on to win a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, showed an interest in acting, his father urged him to shake off his ambitions as “the moonings of a stagestruck girly”.</p> <p>After failing all but three of his O-level exams, Leigh went to London to study acting in the early 1960s. He later won the role of a deaf mute in an episode of the popular TV series <em>Maigret</em>, but then lost interest in performing.</p> <p>Leigh remembers his nascent interest in film-making first taking hold when he was a boy in Salford attending a funeral, a Jewish wake or shiva held at a family home. As he watched the coffin being carried downstairs and listened to a family argument die down, Leigh tells Yentob he suddenly thought it would make a great film. “It was already a tragi-comic scene, you see,” he says.</p> <p>In London the director eventually attracted funding for his first film from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/albert-finney\" title=\"link to Guardian profile site\">the actor/director Albert Finney</a>, who was then in his mid-30s. Finney decided to use his newfound wealth to fund three films: one by Stephen Frears, who made <em>Gumshoe,</em> starring Finney; another by Tony Scott, called <em>Loving Memory</em>; and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/01/mike-leigh-on-bleak-moments\" title=\"link to Leigh on this film\">Leigh’s <em>Bleak Moments</em></a>, which was hailed by the late American film critic Roger Ebert as a masterpiece.</p> <p>In the <em>Imagine</em> documentary, Leigh talks through his early career in theatre and television, before he was finally able to attract funding to make a feature film again, 17 years later, still using his trademark improvisational techniques.</p> <p>Leigh has two sons with his former wife, the actress Alison Steadman, and, according to one of them, he may not have an entirely encouraging attitude to the arts himself. Interviewed in 2009, his son Leo Leigh, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/17/leo-leigh-swansea-love-story1\" title=\"link to Guardian interview\">also a film-maker</a>, jokingly revealed that his father had warned him away from acting “from junior school. My dad said: ‘If you become an actor, I’ll break your legs.’ ”</p> <p><em>Imagine will be screened on Tuesday 25 November at 10.35pm on BBC1 </em></p>","headline":"My home life was a battlefield: Mike
