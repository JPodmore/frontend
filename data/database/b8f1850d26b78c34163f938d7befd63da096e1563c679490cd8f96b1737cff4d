Our mutual love of film brings out the real me: a chubby teenager with a highlighter, the TV Times and an Augustus Gloop chocolate stash, scheduling movie-watching as if life depended on it. But hearing him murmur “he’s going to die” 10 minutes past the opening credits makes me want to stuff overpriced popcorn into his mouth till he’s picking it out of his nostrils. I’m not totally cruel: I would allow a breathing hole, so we can watch the rest of the film in blissful silence. Luckily, after many years together, a tilt of my right eyebrow is enough to render him speechless.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/mar/20/midnight-cowboy-40th-anniversary\">Ben Walters reports from the 40th anniversary screening of Midnight Cowboy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I first watched <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36282/midnight-cowboy\">Midnight Cowboy</a>, on my own, during one of my teenage marathon sessions.

And when I watched it years later, I didn’t want to see it coming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jul/26/features.comment\">John Schlesinger: Picture imperfect</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I’m no cowboy but I’m a real stud,” Joe keeps telling us. Joe Buck (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000685/\">Jon Voight)</a> is tall, tanned and beautiful but he’s a man with no one, passing through the script of a wretched life. Leaving behind more than one person’s quota of dreadful luck in small-town Texas – abandoned by a mother, raised by a grandmother and her creepy partner – memories float through his mind, with flashbacks of a horrific rape of himself and his girlfriend at the hands of a local gang. Joe’s promiscuity, a calling card for sexual abuse, is also his escape. He plans to milk those rich ladies of New York, and turn the tables on his sexual exploitation.</p> <p>However, a few months in the city leave him sharp-cheekboned and pale. You wonder how many people it will take to screw him over before he realises that the only way to survive the urban jungle is to become a monstrous version of himself. Despite the bravado, Joe remains a man-boy, kind to the core and incapable of hurting others. As he admits at the end: “I’m not much of a hustler.” Bad luck follows him like a cloud. You want to shake him by those broad shoulders.</p> <p>His unconventional relationship with Ratso (Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, played by Dustin Hoffman) is the closest thing to love that Joe has had in his life – it is no irony that this partnership is never sexual. Offering Joe food and shelter and cleaning his clothes (even if it is to earn money as his pimp), Ratso is the only one who places Joe’s needs above his own sexual gratification.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnFoaj8utio\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jnFoaj8utio?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Just as Joe is starting to succeed at getting women to pay him for sex, Ratso’s health deteriorates. Joe makes his partner’s dreams of “Flawida” happen. As the bus heads south, Joe takes charge of Ratso’s incontinence and shame, using boyish humour: “You took a little rest stop that wasn’t on the schedule, is all.” And they both dissolve into giggles.</p> <p>Joe is at peace, and because of Ratso’s dream, he has diverted his escape plan to a land of hope and coconut palms. Ratso tells Joe he wants to be known as Ricco, the cowboy boots go into the bin, and the morning sun kisses their faces. Hope beckons. And then Joe turns to Ratso, who has died with eyes open, staring down the road to Miami. Joe takes into his arms the most enduring love he has ever known, once again alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"effd7b6a4ca4b5e163532177ea9ac47c8ba614bb\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426268803975/815025f7-fbe9-48c4-ac60-9137a7bfeda5-460x328.jpeg\" alt=\"'I'm walking here' … Midnight Cowboy (1969).\" width=\"460\" height=\"328\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’m walking here’ … Midnight Cowboy (1969).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap Stills/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I cry out of shock at the normality of their demise. I cry at the women in cat’s eye glasses who just stare, void of compassion, as grotesque as those rich New York ladies and their lookalike dogs.</p> <p>There are plenty of films which have an off-the-cliff ending, where the world stops. But usually with some sort of fanfare. It’s Joe’s unseen pain that has me bawling every time. I’m crying from a childish hope; the notion that things should get better, that it will be OK in the end. Even after the pointless death of Peter Fonda’s Wyatt in Easy Rider, I felt: well, at least he lived some.</p> <p>With Ratso gone, there is no one to tell Joe’s story; no advocate: he’s just not articulate enough. His mind paralysed at the time of the abuse, Joe retreats into his childish alter ego, alone and scared. Maybe what stirs me most is the realisation that no one has ever loved Joe as much as Ratso. No one apart from us.</p>","headline":"The film that makes me cry: Midnight Cowboy","trailText":"Bad luck follows Jon Voight’s man-boy hustler like a cloud, and the only kind of love he has ever known

the rumour mill working overtime, we sort the wheat from the chaff about Episode VIII and the first Star Wars spin-off film, Rogue One</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>There have been so many porkies told about the new Star Wars movies that, last August, the online magazine Slate invented a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/21/star-wars-rumour-generator-gives-fans-chance-to-decide-plot-title-and-poster\">Rumour Generator</a> to help budding Jedis concoct their own preposterous space opera storylines. There have been suggestions that Gareth Edwards’ spin-off episode centres on a young Han Solo, and also that it focuses on a group of bounty hunters vying to steal plans to the Death Star. Now, thanks to Disney’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/12/star-wars-episode-8-release-date-spin-off-rogue-one-felicity-jones\"> presentation to shareholders in San Francisco on Thursday</a>, we now know a little more about the film, and have also had some details for the still-untitled Episode VIII confirmed. Here’s a quick rundown …</p> <h2>Looper director Rian Johnson will direct Episode VIII</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c76303ada93fa6eeaa382c659ce8ddc49d0d4d15\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426264968697/019685f3-d45a-4511-a24e-160f5a32de19-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rian Johnson\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Looper director Rian Johnson to helm Star Wars Episode VIII. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 41-year-old US film-maker, also known for the noirish high-school thriller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/112157/brick\">Brick</a> and several of the best episodes of Breaking Bad, is also writing the screenplay. That makes him the first film-maker since George Lucas (with the ill-fated prequel series) to single-handedly take on both duties for a Star Wars film. What’s more, Johnson is also penning a treatment for Episode IX, so he may end up being more important to the direction of the new trilogy than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/star-wars-episode-vii\">The Force Awakens</a>’ JJ Abrams. Episode VIII is scheduled for release on 26 May 2017.</p> <h2>Gareth Edwards’ spin-off Star Wars movie is titled Rogue One</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbc56b8bd333e235096307cd37c3e2c249590276\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426265108251/c54c3a82-5a86-481f-b6aa-095ac408dc53-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Godzilla director Gareth Edwards\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Godzilla director Gareth Edwards to make Star Wars spin-off Rogue One.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Carr/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The UK-born Godzilla director will be blessed with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-theory-of-everything\">The Theory of Everything</a>’s Felicity Jones as his lead, though there’s no indication at this stage that she’s playing a young Princess Leia. In fact, we don’t know if Rogue One will connect to any of the films from the main saga in anything more than a loose manner. Disney says simply that it will explore “characters and events beyond the core Star Wars saga”.</p> <h2>It might be about X-Wing pilots</h2> <p>One of the most iconic supporting characters from the original Star Wars movies is Wedge Antilles, the only pilot to survive both Death Star runs and the co-founder, with Luke Skywalker, of <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/12/star-wars-spinoff-rogue-one-explained-brief-history-rogue-squadron\">the Rebel Alliance’s Rogue Squadron</a>. “Rogue One” would have been the call sign of the leader of the squadron, according to Star Wars tradition. Played mostly by Denis Lawson in the original films, Wedge might just be second to bounty hunter Boba Fett in the pantheon of minor Star Wars characters whom hardcore fans find fascinating. Rogue Squadron has featured in the “Expanded Universe” series of novels and comic books, so this spin-off route makes sense.</p> <h2>The concept art for the movie resembles the video game Halo</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ff56c5a81dd314f260a0e0442548674fbebc839\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426265332513/f4de7606-8c51-4046-880c-5e5c0e463ba9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Halo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Halo PR</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Disney says Rogue One was inspired by an idea from a visual effects supervisor, so it’s perhaps little surprise that there’s likely to be a video game influence. Reports from the Disney briefing are that <a href=\"http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-report-avengers-age-ultron-clip-inside-out-trailer-star-wars-rogue-one-concept-art-spoilers-74601/\">concept art</a> shown to investors features a group of four to five heavily-armoured soldiers storming towards a helicopter-like ship releasing more troops, with two to three “tough-looking ships” in the background. The dark grey <a href=\"http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-rogue-one-concept-art/\">look of the art</a> apparently reminded observers of the science fiction video game <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/halo\">Halo</a>, and the earthbound action would appear to torpedo the X-Wing theory.</p> <h2>Disney hasn’t got the script right yet</h2> <p>While Episode VIII snagged Johnson and The Force Awakens boasts Abrams alongside original The Empire Strikes Back screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan, the first Star Wars spin-off effort appears to have been less fortunate. Edwards still has some cachet after delivering microbudget sci-fi debut <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/136970/monsters\">Monsters</a> in 2010, but fans and critics were left a little nonplussed by last year’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/godzilla\">Godzilla</a> reboot, despite the best efforts of Breaking Bad’s Bryan Cranston to add some star quality. Rogue One began life under the eye of screenwriter Gary Whitta (best known for the execrable After Earth), but he was removed from the project <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garywhitta/status/576071947190030336\">earlier this year</a>. The current writer is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/34361/antz\">Antz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/121987/golden.compass\">The Golden Compass</a> scripter Chris Weitz, whose CV ranges from the semi-decent (About a Boy, American Pie) to the utterly bland (The Twilight Saga: New Moon). Where’s Kasdan when you need him?</p> <h2>The film debuts next year</h2> <p>Rogue One has a release date of 16 December 2016, almost exactly a year after the release of The Force Awakens. That’s precisely in line with Disney’s plan to give us a new Star Wars movie every year between now and 2019.</p>","headline":"Star Wars Episode 8 and Rogue One: what we know","trailText":"With the

Ghostbusters just doesn’t fit the mould<br></p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>The term “cinematic universe” didn’t exist prior to 2008, when Marvel debuted its first in-house superhero epic, Iron Man. But ever since the Disney-owned studio proved with the $1.5bn (£1bn) The Avengers that it’s possible to build a series of related properties that unite to form an even more enormous box office megalith, Hollywood has been all over it.</p> <p>First came the predictable news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/13/warner-bros-announce-dc-comics-superhero-films\">rival Warner Bros was planning its own series of linked superhero movies</a> based on its rights to the DC Comics back catalogue (famous for Batman, Superman, the Justice League and so on). Then Sony announced doomed proposals to exploit its limited rights to Spider-Man by pushing for <a href=\"http://screenrant.com/venom-movie-amazing-spider-man-sinister-six-sony/2/\">films based on related characters such as Venom and the Sinister Six team of supervillains</a>. Twentieth Century Fox was at one point expected to follow suit with a run of movies based on individual X-Men characters, but at the moment seems happy putting out the odd Wolverine episode in among its series of films about the ongoing mutant battle between Professor X and Magneto.</p> <p>Then two years ago it emerged that Marvel owner Disney planned to exploit its newly attained Star Wars rights by building a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/16/star-wars-films-origins-standalone\">second cinematic universe incorporating several standalone “origin tales”</a> (featuring iconic characters such as Han Solo, Boba Fett and Obi Wan Kenobi) on top of its previously announced trilogy of new movies. And so, the universe concept leapt the genetic gap from comic-book movies to space opera, and a thousand tunnel-visioned Hollywood executives began to wonder if the idea might work for their own properties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e99a3a9917c9b270be220fcff3cc125a8fc97efe\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426183511846/e2c9e6a0-0611-49f7-89c0-4dc317bcfd17-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Slimer in Ghostbusters\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hold tight for a Simer origins movie … Ghostbusters, 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Columbia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The phenomenon appears to have reached its zenith this week following reports that Sony is planning a cinematic universe based on Ghostbusters. So we won’t just be getting the recently announced reboot starring Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, et al, but also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/10/ghostbusters-cinematic-universe-channing-tatum-sony\">a “male” Ghostbusters movie featuring Channing Tatum</a>, as well as various nebulous future outings set in the same world. Hold tight for a Slimer origins movie, perhaps charting the chubby green spirit’s descent into incorporeal corpulence, or a big-screen prequel about the early years of Gozer and Zuul. I’d pay money to see a film about the continuing adventures in high-end accountancy of Louis Tully, but only because it’s been such a long time since we saw Rick Moranis in the multiplexes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Marvel was inspired by a desire to recreate the excitement of long-established comic books</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The problem here is that Sony seems to have completely misunderstood how Marvel delivered its incredibly successful series of linked films and, more importantly, why the Disney-owned studio struck upon the concept in the first place. The original cinematic universe was not magicked out of thin air by a Doctor Strange-like movie bigwig to increase profits (though the studio undoubtedly saw the potential for exploiting its fabulous back catalogue of superheroes). It was inspired by a desire to recreate the excitement of long-established comic books, whereby different characters routinely cross-pollinate, on the big screen. The studio introduced the likes of Iron Man, Thor and Captain America in their own outings before uniting them in The Avengers – because that’s pretty much exactly what has been happening in print over the past 50 or 60 years.</p> <p>There’s a parallel with Star Wars, too. While the live-action film series itself has always remained a linear concoction, the expanded universe of novels and comics long ago proved that fans were interested in exploring a space opera beyond the stories of Luke and Anakin Skywalker. Characters such as Yoda and Solo have become so iconic over the past 35 years that few fans would begrudge Disney exploiting them for standalone origins movies, provided the quality levels were maintained and the Jedi master didn’t zip around the screen like a CGI frog in a blender, Attack of the Clones-style. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ee863a833fabae65750e6adba92c0c3715d8f7c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426183814540/ba0c3de3-758c-48fa-b127-ebe9af6dca2f-460x195.jpeg\" alt=\"Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith. \" width=\"460\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wider space opera … Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucasfilm/ILM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ghostbusters, wonderful as the original 1984 comedy is, simply doesn’t fit the remit for expansion into a wider universe. The weak 1989 sequel did little to create a sense of a richer world of ghosts and spirits beyond Manhattan, and if Sony is planning to adapt episodes of either of the two animated TV series to carry the Ghostbusters name then it really is in trouble. The news that the rights-starved studio wants to go down the cinematic universe route is likely to be met with incredulity, just at a time when the film series’ revival had been creating such positive buzz.</p> <p>People like the idea of Feig’s female Ghostbusters, because it sounds like something a little different. But reaction to the Tatum-led “male” film has been <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2015/03/10/boy-led-ghostbusters-announced-because-girls-cant-even-have-one-series-for-themselves/\">mixed to say the least</a>, largely because it <a href=\"http://www.slashfilm.com/infographic-hollywoods-waning-creativity/\">sounds like nothing new at all</a>. So one can only imagine the response on Twitter when Sony, which is <a href=\"http://www.latino-review.com/news/exclusive-sonys-now-working-on-an-aunt-may-movie\">rumoured to have once considered proposals for an Aunt May movie</a> linked to its Spider-Man rights, reveals its far-out ideas for the next stage of the Ghostbusters universe. The studio will be called out, rightly, for clutching at spectral straws. </p>","headline":"Who I gotta call to stop the Ghostbusters universe expanding?","trailText":"The Star Wars and Marvel cinematic universes work by riffing on favourite characters.

This will be the first boxing movie that Martin Scorsese has done since Raging Bull.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49f09cd89ea3a7a846f0352687ea983d3436660e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426264062451/96be7218-b120-4f76-8e45-6dbcbb8a2c34-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mike Tyson in September 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Tyson in September 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Menendez/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the same interview, Foxx also says that he wants Tyson’s children to run up to him and say ‘Daddy’ because of how similar the pair will look.

Lynch, that champion of the arts, says graffiti is ruining the world. And he’s right – this hypermasculine display is destroying our environment</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>It’s a familiar scenario. Older person gets angry with modern world and rages against the visual white noise of graffiti that is, well, everywhere these days. </p> <p>Only this time the angry old man is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/13/david-lynch-decries-pathetic-arts-funding-cuts-and-graffiti\">film director David Lynch</a>, whose surrealist pedigree and bizarre sense of style make his condemnation of graffiti difficult to dismiss as mere grey-haired grumpiness. Lynch says graffiti is ruining the world and making our planet ugly. He’s right, of course. The fame of street artists like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/11/bristol-enclave-and-spiritual-home-of-banksy-threatened-by-yuppie-flats-plan\">Banksy</a> and a general sense that graffiti is the natural art expression of the kids crushes dissent about this guttural art form. We are all subdued by it. We go along with it, so as not to seem uncool, daddyo. </p> <p>But how much graffiti actually adds anything to the world? It takes someone as <a href=\"http://cdn.pursuitist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/David-Lynch-Designs-Womens-Fashion-Collection-For-Live-The-Process.jpg\">unshakably avant garde</a> in his credentials as Lynch to state the obvious, that scrawled and spray-painted inchoate messages on every corner of every city do not actually enrich our world. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"452641c1878335e943c8d38e5fa3883d86bdddf5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426257335401/57d740d8-420e-4cb9-87a4-8177b206af91-460x296.jpeg\" alt=\"A new stencil and spray paint artwork, attributed to Banksy, in London, 2011.\" width=\"460\" height=\"296\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A stencil and spray paint work, attributed to Banksy, in London, 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The vast majority of graffiti is ugly, stupid and vaguely threatening. A tiny portion of it is witty or creative. It is the dreck, not the rough diamond art, that most of us encounter most of the time. And we have learned to put on a forced grin and tell ourselves it is the look of our time. </p> <p>Graffiti is a pretentious subcultural backbeat that is replicated everywhere in much the same style, the same chunky lettering and coded messages. It is boring and expresses a generalised contempt for community, kindness, and the weak. How can leftists like this stuff? After all it is so blatantly hypermasculine, aggressive and destructive of people’s desire for a decent environment. It is in fact proof that men are still in charge of the world. There is far more creativity and craft in, say, crochet but because that is traditionally seen as a “feminine” activity no one bends over backwards to praise it as art. But graffiti, associated as it is with alienated young men, is treated with absurd reverence by people who should know better. </p> <p>So congratulations to Mr Lynch. He knows how to aim a grouch. It was high time someone stood up to the vile oppression that is graffiti.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9656df61f4ed39fded54f4b5f3002fa89197ff1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426258537851/d0cba93d-8e8c-40ee-a6d2-f8d834d2348f-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Athens, Greece: graffiti displays a contempt for community.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Athens, Greece: graffiti displays a contempt for community.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","headline":"Graffiti is ugly, stupid and threatening – there's more creativity in crochet","trailText":"David Lynch, that champion of the arts, says graffiti is ruining the world.

Allstar/Cinetext/UNITED ARTISTS/Allstar/Cinetext/UNITED ARTISTS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The decision was criticised by the Tories in Wales as a missed opportunity. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: “I’m not convinced that refusing permission for the Senedd to feature in one of the biggest movies of the year – on movie screens in every corner of the world – was the right decision.</p> <p>“From a Welsh tourism perspective, that’s the sort of publicity money simply can’t buy.” </p> <p>His colleague Darren Millar compared a pair of political opponents to the Chuckle Brothers and claimed that if they could appear in the Senedd on a weekly basis, James Bond should be invited in too. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DarrenMillarAM/statuses/576284790443405312\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>We have the Chuckle Brothers in the Senedd on a weekly basis - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlsargeant1\">@carlsargeant1</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeightonAndrews\">@LeightonAndrews</a> - why can&#39;t we have James Bond? #007</p>&mdash; Darren Millar (@DarrenMillarAM) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarrenMillarAM/status/576284790443405312\">March 13, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>More seriously, the first minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones, distanced himself from the decision and insisted: “As a government we are doing everything we can to attract film makers to Wales.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/fmwales/statuses/576342847785476096\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>RT <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WelshGovernment\">@WelshGovernment</a>: We did not make the decision to refuse James Bond filming in the Senedd chamber.

Sixty assembly members sit in its Siambr. Its “mushroom cloud” style wooden ceiling and circular viewing gallery have often been lauded for their unique architecture and design. <br /></p> <p>In a statement, the assembly said: “The Senedd’s Siambr is the home of Welsh democracy and seat of government for Wales.<br /></p> <p>“Some media activity is allowed in the Siambr when it relates to the work of the assembly or reflects the Siambr’s status as the focal point of Welsh civic life. It is not a drama studio.</p> <p>“Decisions on requests from the creative industries to use the assembly’s estate are made on a case-by-case basis, and we are proud to have collaborated with many television and film companies on drama productions such as Sherlock and Dr Who.</p> <p>“The request by James Bond to use the Siambr was turned down and they were offered alternative locations on the estate which they subsequently declined.”</p>","headline":"Welsh assembly refuse James Bond licence to film","trailText":"Criticism of decision to deny request by makers of new 007 movie, Spectre, to

greatest English and French performances from the star of Suite Française</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>While Kristin Scott Thomas <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/31/kristin-scott-thomas-interview\">may have threatened to quit working in movies on occasion</a>, a relatively steady stream of film roles suggests that retirement is still a long way off. This week sees her effortlessly stealing wartime romance Suite Française from star Michelle Williams as a tyrannical mother-in-law, and to celebrate, we’ve gone through her varied CV to recall her greatest hits.</p> <h2>Bitter Moon</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ2db-CD7xc\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZ2db-CD7xc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Before she bitchily lusted all over Hugh Grant in Four Weddings and a Funeral, Scott Thomas played his wife in Roman Polanski’s kinky psychodrama. While Grant’s sexual obsession dominated the proceedings, Scott Thomas sashayed her way into the spotlight in this memorably lurid scene where she enjoys a crowd-pleasing cruise ship dance with Emmanuelle Seigner. Bonus points for staying on her feet while on stormy seas.</p> <h2>The English Patient</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z40Tipkm4IA\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z40Tipkm4IA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57bOy2Dzjg\">While Elaine Benes might have loathed it</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ng-interactive/2015/feb/07/starry-starry-night-oscar-winners-on-hollywoods-biggest-prize?CMP=share_btn_tw\">Lauren Bacall resented it</a>, Anthony Minghella’s romantic melodrama was buried in praise on release, especially from the Academy, who gave Scott Thomas her first and only nomination to date. Her tragic arc as a woman left to die alone in the desert gave this scene, as she begged her lover to return, an unforgettably haunting edge.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/12/suite-franaise-michelle-williams-founders-in-saccharine-version-nemirovsky-bestseller\">Suite Française review – Michelle Williams sleepwalks through wartime</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>I’ve Loved You So Long</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX7PckDUMA4\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BX7PckDUMA4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>While the 90s might have seen her corner the respectable, if easily corrupted, English wife market, the late noughties transported Scott Thomas to France where she provided some of her greatest work. The best of which was her challenging role as a woman released from prison after 15 years. A muted performance finally gives way to a devastating breakdown in this flawlessly executed final scene.</p> <h2>Leaving</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdB4YXN_-DE\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JdB4YXN_-DE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Another one of her finest French performances allowed her the chance to take what could have been a soapy melodrama (woman cheats on husband with younger man) and enrich it with depth and pathos. In this moment, her composed façade is teared away by her aggrieved husband leading to a violent confrontation.</p> <h2>Only God Forgives</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--z1M-524E\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H--z1M-524E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>While Nicolas Winding Refn’s atmospheric Drive followup might have included even less Ryan Gosling dialogue than before, Scott Thomas was allowed a string of perverse one-liners to inflict on her on-screen son.

the agency has shown itself likely to make terrible choices more worthy of callow fraternity brothers than then protectors of the president</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Agent <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0251141/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\">Frank Horrigan</a> would be angry reading about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/11/secret-service-agents-under-investigation-after-late-night-car-crash\">the latest comedy of errors</a> attributed to the drunken shenanigans of Secret Service agents who wanted to party so hard that they brought it to the White House lawn. Agent <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009925/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t10\">Aaron Pierce</a> would be mortified and dumbfounded that superiors <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-service-agents-investigated-for-late-night-car-accident-at-white-house/2015/03/11/9c853906-c7ff-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html\">reportedly ordered agents on the scene</a> to ignore the accident and send the drunken perpetrators home. </p> <p>Like many others before them, Agents Horrigan and Pierce worked for years as Secret Service agents, made many sacrifices in the name of their jobs and did their best to never betray the trust of the presidents they guarded or the public they served. Unfortunately, Agents Horrigan and Pierce are fictional characters: Clint Eastwood played Horrigan in the 1993 thriller In the Line of Fire; Glenn Morshower played Pierce on the television series 24.</p> <p>That they’re fictional might be for the best – except for the safety of the president of the United States – given that the real life Secret Service has shown itself capable of repeated flagrant miscalculations, mismanagement and terrible choices worthy of a bunch of callow fraternity brothers rather than the steady and steadfast protectors of the president. Eastwood’s characters are hardly known for their kind words for silly, wanton or careless behavior (unless one counts as evidence <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/31/clint-eastwood-chair-speech-romney\">his conversations with </a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/31/clint-eastwood-chair-speech-romney\">furniture</a>); Morshower’s character was a steadfast professional who remained dedicated and devoted to the nation and the ideals he served to protect, even when he had his reservations about the motives and ethics of the politicians jockeying for power near the president. Whomever they might’ve once been based on, those agents apparently retired and left a bunch of numbnuts with the keys to the armory.</p> <p>Hollywood imagines the Secret Service as an agency full of men and women of nearly superhuman grit, determination and (in Eastwood’s case), total indestructibility. Fictional Secret Service agents like Horrigan, Pierce and the agents seen in action films like Vantage Point and The Sentinal and even comedies like First Daughter, Dave and Guarding Tess are stalwarts who guard the nation’s leaders and visiting dignitaries. On-screen agents might seem at worst robotic, but it is obvious that, like any finely trained operatives, they are excellent at their jobs. It’s comforting to think that the men and women serving our country are nearly indestructible and disobey protocol only when it stands in the way of catching the real bad guys.</p> <p>If only real life were so filled with honor and duty: recent reports of the Secret Service’s multiple debacles protecting the White House, from <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/white-house-shooting/\">missing gunshots aimed at the residence</a> to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/us/white-house-intruder-got-farther-than-first-reported-official-says.html?_r=0\">letting an armed man into the East Room</a>, are almost less embarrassing than the latest, juvenile prank. Following a retirement party, two agents reportedly hopped into a government vehicle, put on the flashing lights and then drove through White House security checkpoints and right into a security barricade at the scene of an ongoing investigation of a suspicious package. It makes the agents who <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-service-scandal-colombian-woman-describes-night-of-carousing-with-agents/2012/05/04/gIQAcwyi1T_story.html\">got caught carousing and paying for sex in Cartagena, Colombia</a> seem positively dignified by comparison.</p> <p> Adding insult to injury, officers on the scene allegedly wanted to arrest the joyriding Secret Service agents but were ordered by a supervisor to let the malefactors go home. That is the exact sort of tail-covering that has offended Americans when exposed in places like Ferguson, Missouri or other localities where law enforcement seems like it would rather protect its own than live up to its responsibilities to protect and serve the public. The Secret Service was supposed to be different<em> and</em> better: more Frank Horrigan, less <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005556/\">Frank Drebin</a>.</p> <p>Fictional depictions of the Secret Service and other government organizations usually highlight employees’ devotion to duty and getting an important job done. The truth – which the Secret Service seems intent on reminding us – is that actual government agencies are made up of people who are perfectly capable of making terrible choices, terrible people who would rather not get into trouble, and those who would rather cover up the formers’ mistakes than deal with the paperwork. </p> <p>The Secret Service does difficult and dangerous work, and they’re supposed to be protecting the president, not drunkenly toilet-papering his front yard. In a movie, the agents involved would all be walking out of the building with boxes of their stuff, only to save the president in the third act because they couldn’t let the job go. In real life, it’s clear that none of them cared enough about the people they were sworn to protect to catch a cab home to their wives. </p> <p>Horrigan would be so pissed off.</p>","headline":"Secret

moves","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-13T10:47:23Z","sectionId":"film","id":"film/filmblog/2015/mar/13/ryan-gosling-dance-videos-ranked","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/46teh","standfirst":"<p>A new set of videos show the pre-teen alternately impressing and alarming in MC Hammer pants. But which is the best performance from the Oscar-nominee-to-be?</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Ryan Gosling’s brooding persona, carefully carved in largely dialogue-free performances in Drive, Only God Forgives and The Place Beyond the Pines, exists snugly alongside his role as a tumblr-inspiring ovary-whispering ladykiller, influenced by his roles in The Notebook and Crazy, Stupid Love and his gif-ready abs.</p> <p>If you’re a fan of his more meme-ready side then this past week has offered up a bounty of viral riches. </p> <p>Before Gosling became an Oscar-nominated actor and before he even took his place in the Mickey Mouse Club, he was a one man rhythm machine, taking part in a 1992 showcase from Ontario’s Elite Dance Centre. A newly unearthed set of videos, brought to the web by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JaneChupick\">Jane Chupick</a>, a woman whose cousin danced at the same studio, reveal that Gosling was a fierce mover with an intense fanbase at a young age. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RyanGosling/status/574305775721447424\">Even Gosling agrees that he “peaked early”...</a></p> <p>Here’s our professional* take on his skillz:</p> <p>*I’ve seen half of a Step Up movie </p> <h2>4. Drive time</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8MUYBIvmik\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M8MUYBIvmik?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>What a way to start. A dramatic entrance for Gosling and his slightly ill-fitting Danny Zuko costume sees him gyrating on top of a fake car like he’s totally not even a 12-year-old boy. We then get an overly forceful taste of his singing voice which serves as perfect distraction for his understandable difficulty in taking off his jacket without the sleeves getting bunched up at the wrists. Just to ensure he’s not upstaged, the camera pans back to reveal an average dancer age of 55.</p> <h2>3. Backup gangster squad</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hpmoIu0CyY\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-hpmoIu0CyY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>We’d take a hefty bet that Gosling’s mother or maybe even aunt was involved in the staging for the majority of these dances, since young Ryan is the epicentre of them all. Just to show how few damns are given, Gosling wears a baggy T-shirt and jeans while his dancing minions are styled up like bridesmaids at a beach wedding. But what about the moves? We get everything from the “hands tied behind the back while legs spasm all over the shop” Riverdance to a really impressive use of a pondering chin/hand combo. The confidence of it all.</p> <h2>2. Ryan and the real girls</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lovOufEEx5Y\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lovOufEEx5Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Yet again annoying every other parent in the room, Ryan takes centre stage in this slightly more ambitious snippet. The jeans have been upgraded to some MC Hammer/Aladdin pants and Gosling’s moves are as varied as we’ve seen them. He does seem to have quite a soft spot for Macaulay Culkin’s hands-on-shocked-face look from Home Alone though, which, given that the film was out two years prior, does age his style somewhat.</p> <h2>1. Hey girls, will you dance with me?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGFRG09sHag\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGFRG09sHag?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>More Hammer pants and more inappropriate woo-ing as Gosling dials it up a bit for the pinnacle of his one-man dance extravaganza. Grinding to Cathy Dennis’s Touch Me, he shows his power over women with one simple move that forces them to the floor with a nifty kick of his feet. It’s pretty much his audition for The Notebook.</p>","headline":"Crazy, stupid, love: we review Ryan Gosling's 12-year-old dance moves","trailText":"A new set of videos show the pre-teen alternately impressing and alarming in MC Hammer pants.

to be excluded from forthcoming films, including Marvel and Star Wars properties, CEO Bob Iger tells shareholders</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Disney has banned smoking in all of its forthcoming movies, unless characters being depicted were historically known for lighting up.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thewrap.com/disney-expands-on-screen-smoking-ban-to-marvel-pixar-lucasfilm/\">The news broke at Disney’s annual shareholder meeting in San Francisco on Thursday</a>, during which the studio also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/12/frozen-2-sequel-disney-to-be-let-go-jennifer-lee-chris-buck\">confirmed plans for Frozen 2</a> and revealed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/12/star-wars-episode-8-release-date-spin-off-rogue-one-felicity-jones\">title of its Star Wars spin-off project</a>, Rogue One. Walt Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger said he would “absolutely prohibit” smoking in all Disney films going forward, including those produced by the studio’s wholly owned comic-book-movie division, Marvel Studios, and Star Wars unit Lucasfilm.</p> <p>“I thought it was the right thing for us to do,” said Iger, who was responding to a query from an investor. “We are extending our policy to prohibit smoking in movies across the board: Marvel, Lucas, Pixar and Disney films,” he said. “Except when we are depicting a historical figure who may have smoked at the time. For instance, we’ve been doing a movie on Abraham Lincoln, he was a smoker, and we would consider that acceptable.</p> <p>“But in terms of any new characters that are created for any of those films, under any of those labels, we will absolutely prohibit smoking in any of those films.”</p> <p>Disney supposedly banned smoking in family films in 2007, two months after US ratings body the Motion Picture Association of America said it would consider the habit when awarding film certificates. The policy does not appear to have been universally enforced, however, with the character of Absolom the caterpillar <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6lu0IzD3lw4\">retaining his trademark hookah</a> in Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland remake from 2010.</p>","headline":"Clearing the air: Disney to ban smoking in all future movies","trailText":"Cigarettes to be excluded from forthcoming

on the new James Bond movie have had their efforts to clean up the Italian city praised by locals, but Welsh National Assembly denies 007 permission to shoot at Cardiff HQ</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>Ahead of James Bond’s arrival in Rome to shoot new instalment Spectre, some locals openly questioned whether the eternal city was in any state to receive the dapper British spy. But a month into the shoot, and despite misgivings over increased traffic from some Romans, director Sam Mendes’ team has won praise for helping to clean up rubbish-strewn, graffiti-plagued areas as part of the filming process,<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/italy/rome/11465758/James-Bond-film-crew-clean-up-Rome-on-Spectre-shoot.html http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/03/rome-james-bond-shoot-cleanup-spectre-007\"> reports the Telegraph</a>.</p> <p>Producers are said to have worked with city council workers on the clean-up project, while their introduction of private security firms has helped rid the city of much-detested unlicensed parking attendants in the touristy Trastavere district near the River Tiber. Location fees have brought an estimated €1m into public coffers and news website Linkiesta last week summed up the positive reaction to the arrival of 007 production company Eon with the header “The mayor of Rome is Bond. James Bond”.</p> <p>The picture is a far cry from the one painted last month by campaigners writing on the <a href=\"http://www.bastacartelloni.it/2015/01/ciak-si-gira-nel-degrado-dal-22.html \">Basta Cartelloni blog</a>, who suggested prior to Bond’s arrival that the state of the city was likely to shame Romans. They published photographs showing the 15th-century Ponte Sisto pedestrian bridge appearing dirty and adorned with graffiti and garbage, with the nearby Tiber Farnesina street (where a car chase was due to take place) appearing to be in a similar state.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the makers of Spectre have received a less cheery welcome in Cardiff, where producers have been refused permission to shoot in the main building of the Welsh Assembly, known as the Senedd, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-31861644\">reports the BBC</a>.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Assembly said in a statement: “The Senedd’s Siambr [chamber] is the home of Welsh democracy and seat of government for Wales. Some media activity is allowed in the Siambr when it relates to the work of the assembly or reflects the Siambr’s status as the focal point of Welsh civic life. It is not a drama studio.</p> <p>“Decisions on requests from the creative industries to use the assembly’s estate are made on a case by case basis, and we are proud to have collaborated with many television and film companies on drama productions such as Sherlock and Dr Who. The request by James Bond to use the Siambr was turned down and they were offered alternative locations on the estate which they subsequently declined.”</p> <p>It is not known why Bond would have wanted to shoot in the chamber. Producers have been filming the 24th official 007 movie in London, Rome and the Austrian Alps over the past month. Daniel Craig returns for his fourth turn as Bond in Spectre, which also stars Christoph Waltz, Léa Seydoux and Monica Bellucci. The film is expected to hit UK cinemas on 23 October and will debut in the US on 6 November.</p>","headline":"When in Rome: James Bond team win praise for litter-picking Spectre

Or, more accurately, a surprisingly wide international audience used to find Vince Vaughn funny. The rambunctious persona premiered in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/oct/26/my-favourite-film-swingers\">Swingers</a> – pure id in a party-hard alpha-male – then recycled in hit films such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/jul/15/1\">Wedding Crashers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,1291454,00.html\">Dodgeball</a>, made him a reliably lucrative booking. But last weekend saw his latest comedy – Unfinished Business, a farce about a work trip which gets out of hand – become the biggest flop of his career so far, with toxic reviews and audience apathy.</p> <p>So far, so predictable: Vaughn’s recent back catalogue – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/09/delivery-man-review\">Delivery Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155768/internship\">The Internship</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148836/watch\">The Watch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/20/the-dilemma-film-review\">The Dilemma</a> – have all crashed and burned at the box office. His last financial hit was the one-star <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/15/couples-retreat-review\">Couples Retreat</a> back in 2009 (AKA the film you almost watched on a plane that one time). So what went wrong? How did Vaughn go from being able to open a movie on the power of his name to being beaten by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/fifty-shades-of-grey\">a film about S&amp;M with no recognisable stars in its fourth week of release</a>?</p> <p>“Vince has just made some really unfortunate choices,” says Steven Gaydos, executive editor of Variety, “and I don’t think he’s got proper orientation around his strengths. He’s a terrific actor who had monster comedy hits, but he’s not a Will Ferrell – that is, a guy born to make us laugh.”</p> <p>“Stars face a tough dilemma,” says box-office analyst Charles Gant. “Either keep churning out what worked in the past, or try something new. Vaughn seems to be doing the former, but who really wants to see a fish-out-of-water Euro-business-trip comedy starring Vaughn, Dave Franco and Tom Wilkinson? With Chris Pratt, Zac Efron and Robert De Niro it <em>might</em> have worked, but the premise is pretty unappealing.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d57644fe5167853b0d1df58391da2d6d348ab50\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426178251341/897f5042-3c2e-40d1-8666-cdf3bd94c041-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart in Get Hard.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart in Get Hard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trouble is: Vaughn is not alone. In 2004, the term <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frat_Pack\">“Frat Pack”</a> was <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-06-15-frat-pack_x.htm\">coined by USA Today</a> to describe a group of actors who were then starring alongside each other in a string of hit comedies. Their films included <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/99240\">Starsky &amp; Hutch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/101940/anchorman\">Anchorman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/tropic-thunder\">Tropic Thunder </a>and it seemed – for a while at least; a few halcyon days in the mid-noughties – that the whole world over was happy to lap up the Pack’s output.</p> <p>Then the laughs dwindled and fans dissipated. Ben Stiller wisely chased those who now only went to the movies with their kids, with family-friendly franchises such as Madagascar and Night at the Museum. When he aimed his laughs at those nearer his own age (remember <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/03/tower-heist-film-review\">Tower Heist</a>?) the response was much more muted. Jack Black’s appeal went south after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/130111/year-one\">Year One</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/01/the-big-year-review\">The Big Year</a> (note to Black’s agent: avoid titles with “year” in them), while Owen Wilson man-child comedies <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/10/hall-pass-film-review\">Hall Pass</a> and Are You Here barely registered.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/05/unfinished-business-review\">Unfinished Business review – indifferent post-Horrible Bosses corporate comedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the 11 years since the Frat Pack was christened, and the 18-odd since it formed, the climate of comedy has inevitably changed. The audience, also. The ever-crucial younger crowd, relied on by studios to come out in force on the increasingly-important opening weekend, have diminishing interest in watching men not far off 50 imitate children. Google-funded flop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155768/internship\">The Internship</a> highlighted the Frat Packers’s misstep in this respect. Reuniting Wilson and Vaughn eight years after Wedding Crashers, the jokes – mainly of the “they’ve never even used a webcam before!” variety – served as an uncomfortable reminder of the divide between the stars on screen and the target demographic.</p> <p>The need to age gracefully is acutely explored in Noah Baumbach’s comedy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/while-were-young-ben-stiller-review-noah-baumbach-adam-driver\">While We’re Young</a>, out in the UK at the start of next month. It’s a reunion for the director and Stiller, who he took to dark (if <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=greenberg.htm\">financially unrewarding</a>) heights in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/134351/greenberg\">Greenberg</a>; another film about the gap between being an adolescent imitating an adult and the terror of bill-paying, dream-burying responsibility. Stiller’s character in the new movie alternates between craving acceptance from his sophisticated elders and admiration from hipsters 20 years his junior. It’s a perfect fit for the star, almost uncomfortably so, and he delivers arguably his greatest performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df28e81d8ead48d078ce5c01ef8d484f0bb3f03a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/12/1426178313516/359a656b-f2f3-439d-848d-299d464e1773-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in The Wedding Crashers.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in The Wedding Crashers. Allstar Collection/NEW LINE</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It certainly suits him better than his last attempt to “go straight”, 2013’s once-Oscar-tipped remake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-secret-life-of-walter-mitty\">The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</a>. A pricey passion project for Stiller, who also directed, it confused fridge-magnet insight with profundity and wound up a pale imitation of fellow Frat Packer Will Ferrell’s underrated and under-watched 2006 comedy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/115237/stranger.than.fiction\">Stranger Than Fiction</a>. But that inventive, whimsical tale of a man attempting to save his life from inevitability didn’t click with Ferrell’s core audience, despite strong reviews. The actor has made numerous attempts to break the mould, from Woody Allen’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/melinda-and-melinda\">Melinda and Melinda</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/13/everything-must-go-film-review\">Everything Must Go</a>, an adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story. Yet such projects have never landed resoundingly, and he keeps scuttling back to more bankable ground. Plus, when it comes to opening tentpole releases, Ferrell is the obvious exception in the group, with solid returns for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/19/anchorman-2-legend-continues-review\">Anchorman 2</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148981/campaign\">The Campaign</a>.</p> <p>Yet despite this, Ferrell is increasingly unable to carry a comedy by himself. Later this month he teams up with Kevin Hart for Get Hard, playing a businessman preparing to enter prison. It’s a smart match, given that Hart’s fanbase – including<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinhart4real\"> 17.4m Twitter followers</a> - has helped him score a string of recent hits. After that, Ferrell reunites with his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/16/the-other-guys-review\">Other Guys</a> co-star Mark Wahlberg – a lone wolf outside the Pack, who manages to straddle comedy and drama – for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528854/reference\">Daddy’s Home</a> (about a stepfather forced to compete with his wife’s ex-husband).</p> <p>Ferrell’s continued chances to shine have, however, eluded Jack Black, who, bar the odd cameo, hasn’t headed up a film since 2011. His next lead is on the small screen, starring alongside Tim Robbins in The Brink, a comedy about a geopolitical crisis. Vaughn, too, has turned to HBO for salvation: the second season of hit crime show <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/23/vince-vaughn-colin-farrell-true-detective-hbo\">True Detective </a>will see him play a career criminal alongside Colin Farrell (another actor in need of a hit). Speaking to Variety, Vaughn said he was <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/features/vince-vaughn-on-moving-into-adult-storytelling-with-true-detective-1201444574/\">“moving into a more adult part”</a> of his career. Vaughn is 45 in a fortnight.</p> <p>And Wilson too is having a rethink. Late last year we saw him in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Inherent Vice; soon he’ll be seen in his first non-comic part since 2001’s Behind Enemy Lines: an action lead in thriller No Escape.</p> <p>As the Frat Pack disband, others plug the gap. “I think men behaving like idiots never really gets old,” says Gant. “We just need some fresh faces.” Judd Apatow alumni Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen scored the biggest lead role hits of their careers last year with 22 Jump Street and Bad Neighbours (both have sequels already in development). Melissa McCarthy used an Oscar-nominated role in surprise smash Bridesmaids to score three hits in a row; upcoming summer comedy Spy plus a role in the Ghostbusters reboot will test her status as the most consistently bankable comic actor working today.</p> <p>The diversity that McCarthy and Hart represent (and even the nervy, chubby Hill and Rogen, too) suggest that part of the Pack’s key flaw today is its makeup: all white, all male, all of an age. Even their contemporary Apatow isn’t interested in making movies with them anymore. Instead he’s hunting for successors to Girls and producing and directing a vehicle for a relatively unknown woman (Trainwreck, starring Amy Schumer, positioned as one of the summer’s biggest).</p> <p>And this, perhaps, is why the last gasp of the Pack – Zoolander 2, which Stiller and Wilson <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/video/2015/mar/10/zoolander-walk-off-paris-fashion-week-ben-stiller-owen-wilson-full-video\">teased this week</a> on the Valentino catwalk – may just be a stroke of genius. Derek and Hansel were aware they were ageing models ripe for the recycling bin in the first film. Fifteen years on, their plight mirrors that of the actors playing them. Maybe there’s pathos in going out of fashion.</p>","headline":"Hey bro, let it go: how the Frat Pack fell apart","trailText":"In the noughties, Vince Vaughn and buddies including Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell could do no wrong, with megahits such as Wedding Crashers and Dodgeball.

So keep up the great work being champions of the arts.”</p> <p>Lynch became a household name as a director with a rare flair for surreal noir, showcased by his cult 1990s TV show Twin Peaks, but had his formative education as a painter. He revealed his distaste for graffiti, which he said had “ruined the world”.</p> <p>Philadelphia, which he described as his “biggest inspiration” and a “very sick, corrupt, filthy fear-ridden city” when he went to art school there in the 1960s, was said to be the birthplace of graffiti, Lynch said.<br /></p> <p>“Graffiti to me has pretty much ruined the world. It’s ruined it for film, when you go to a place to film, everything is graffitied so if you don’t want it, you have to paint it out,” he said.</p> <p>“So much great architecture is graffitied over, so many great train stations, factories, are graffitied over and its a horrible, horrible thing. Trees have gone away and graffiti has taken their place.” </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9254e7f936b89b02ed169ef687b4954e6562b749\"> <img

class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: QAGOMA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a wide ranging question and answer session, Lynch spoke of everything from his devotion to transcendental meditation (“twice a day, never missed a meditation for 40 years”) to his resentment of anti-smoking regulations and inexplicable love of “smokestacks” and “oil impregnated earth”.<br /></p> <p>He was tight-lipped in response to inevitable questions about details the widely-anticipated<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/06/twin-peaks-returns-weve-waited-long-enough\"> third season of Twin Peaks</a>, which ended prematurely in 1991.<br /></p> <p>However, Lynch did reveal that the idea to revisit the show had its genesis in lunches four years ago with co-writer Mark Frost at “one Hollywood’s oldest restaurants”, Musso and Frank Grill.</p> <p>Lynch’s comments on the importance of arts funding were later applauded by the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, who as arts minister welcomed the auteur in a speech in which she revealed her love of Twin Peaks.</p> <p>Palaszczuk also told reporters she was considering restoring the premier’s literary awards, which were axed by her conservative predecessor Campbell Newman in one of his first acts in office. </p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.qagoma.qld.gov.au/exhibitions/upcoming/davidlynch\">David Lynch: Between

However it’s no secret that most of this attention is not merely unfavourable; but in many cases, the Kim dynasty is the object of ridicule. </p> <p>For the average reader of western media, neither Kim Jong-un nor his late father Kim Jong-il are presented as the embodiment of evil incarnate. Rather, they are the butt of international jokes – often crude or very personal. </p> <p>Independent reports about North Korea are difficult to verify and the country is culturally isolated, leaving speculation and humour to fill the void. </p> <p>There are many ways in which the western media likes to make fun of North Korea: the typical North Korean strongman is portrayed as plump, round-faced, with a bad haircut and strange garb. These ‘tyrants of Pyongyang’ are regarded with a comical, almost clownish air, which can sometimes gloss over claims of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/north-korea-human-rights-abuses-united-nations\">serious human rights abuses</a>.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/20/kim-jong-un-defies-gravity-itself-with-new-haircut\">Kim Jong-un defies gravity with new haircut</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>‘Confrontation maniacs’</h2> <p>It does not help that the North Korean media is fond of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/23/-sp-north-korea-sony-interview\">elaborate expressions and macabre threats</a> that, even when accounting for a translation gap, can be hard to take seriously. </p> <p>Insults thrown at their key antagonists, the “US imperialists and their stooges” sound more comical than menacing: various state leaders have been described as “confrontation maniacs” “rabid dogs” and in the case of former US vice president Dick Cheney “a mentally deranged person steeped in the inveterate enmity towards the system in the DPRK”.<br /></p> <p>But does the average North Korean understand the humour in any of this? Do they know that the rulers of their country, whom they admire or despise – depending on personal political inclinations – are described as a joke? Do they know that Kim Jong-un has been the inspiration for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/20/north-korea-meme-generator-kim-jong-un\">millions of internet memes</a>? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/anthropoceneman/statuses/572815272404520960\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeaselPecker?src=hash\">#WeaselPecker</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/KimJongUn?src=hash\">#KimJongUn</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/jbsIl5NSrC\">pic.twitter.com/jbsIl5NSrC</a></p>&mdash; anthropocene man (@anthropoceneman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anthropoceneman/status/572815272404520960\">March 3, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Kim’s global study group </h2> <p>When Kim Il-sung’s personality cult began to emerge in earnest in the late 1950s, the North Korean media dedicated a lot of time to talking about how popular he was around the world, often profiling eulogies bestowed by other world leaders. Ever since, this alleged popularity has been core to the country’s propaganda.<br /></p> <p>Foreign support to the Kim cult is important to North Korea’s world view. It appears to be the major reason why the North Korean government provides support to assorted Juche study groups worldwide. The groups vary in size and success from being ‘<a href=\"http://www.nknews.org/2014/06/interview-thousands-of-north-korea-juche-supporters-exist-in-nigeria/\">thousands of supporters in Nigeria</a>’ to smaller groups in <a href=\"https://jucheireland.wordpress.com/\">Ireland</a> and <a href=\"http://friendsofkorea.blogspot.co.uk/\">the UK</a>, with Juche sometimes referred to as ‘Kimilsungism’ meaning the study of former leader <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung\">Kim Il-sung</a>’s political thesis. </p> <p>Back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the North Korean government entertained the idea of the Juche ideology <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/dprk/juche.htm\">competing</a> with Leninism, Maoism and other radical leftist ideas.<strong> </strong>They spent a significant amount of their meagre resources but by the late 1970s, it became obvious that such investments had gone nowhere: the idea had won very few authentic supporters. </p> <p>Support was significantly scaled back but Juche study group subsidies were not completely discontinued. Foreign Juche admirers were still occasionally flown to Pyongyang, at the expense of the North Korean state, but their role changed.<br /></p> <p>These supports had became props in the country’s propaganda narrative. Admiring foreigners would regularly appear on TV screens and newspaper pages delivering praise for the leadership.<br /></p> <h2>Global friendships</h2> <p>Today, almost every issue of North Korea’s major newspapers will publish at least one piece on the activities of Kim supporters worldwide. The North Korean people are constantly reminded that their leaders are respected across the world – not only because of the might of their weapons, but also because of the irresistible nature of their ideas.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>State media constantly reminds North Koreans that their leaders are respected across the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This week North Korea announced it was forging a “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/russia-and-north-korea-forge-year-of-friendship-pariah-alliance\">year of friendship</a>” with Russia, deepening economic and political ties which may complicate the west’s relationship to Vladimir Putin – a leader also subject to <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/01/russian-official-burns-obama-with-putin-leopard-pic/\">comical coverage</a> alongside criticism. </p> <p>In the last three days of February North Korean media reported the following events: meetings held in Uganda, Pakistan, Congo, Dominican Republic, Russia, Nigeria, Nepal, Benin and South Africa to celebrate Kim Jong-il’s recent birthday; articles about the Kim family’s great achievement published by newspapers in Germany, Russia, Italy, Thailand, Uruguay, Malaysia, Cambodia; seminars and other events in Italy, Uganda, Egypt, Poland and Austria.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/10/north-korea-tv-propaganda-kim-jong-il\">A propaganda merry-go-round: what North Koreans watch on TV</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In most cases these were small-scale events, paid for by North Korean embassies, and the publications in question were run by either marginal radical newspapers or as paid advertisements by larger outlets. </p> <p>Nonetheless, the average North Korean has no way of knowing that the Die Rote Fahne, which published some homage to Kim Jong-un, is a website run by one of five or six competing, but tiny, communist parties of Germany.</p> <p>North Koreans are bombarded with propaganda which paints their country as a major player, and their leaders as figures which inspire admiration across the world. One article claimed that <a href=\"http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/1997/9704/news4/07.htm\">450 streets in 100 countries had been named after Kim Il-sung</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DPRKbot/statuses/575324182738763776\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Improve The Hygiene And One Will As The Major Tasks Given By The Party Is The Most Important In Demonstrating The Party&#39;s Policies!</p>&mdash; DPRK bot (@DPRKbot) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DPRKbot/status/575324182738763776\">March 10, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>A propaganda-loaded state media and very few western journalists allowed in – and if they are, their movements are strictly monitored – make independent reporting from North Korea very difficult. <a href=\"http://www.nknews.org/2014/03/why-kim-jong-un-hairstyle-order-is-unlikely-true/%20\">NK News have previously called</a> this an “an echo-chamber effect” of rumours based on anonymous sources. </p> <h2>The defector perspective </h2> <p>But North Korea is not regarded with laughter by all. Many refugees I’ve spoken to have a hostile or highly critical attitude to the North Korean government and its leaders. </p> <p>They believe the Kim dynasty is hellbent on furthering their own malign interests – not a bunch of clowns whose insults are as ridiculous as their haircuts. Furthermore, when they encounter such attitudes they can sometimes feel offended, since these jokes are seen as an insult to their country too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/20/north-korea-meme-generator-kim-jong-un\">Add brilliance!

As a global merchandising phenomenon – <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/guess-frozen-dresses-sold/story?id=26679037\">more than three million Elsa dresses have sold worldwide</a> – the film has helped push Disney to record profits.</p> <p>The company also used Thursday’s meeting to announce its latest plans for the Star Wars film franchise. The eighth episode in the series will be released on 26 May, 2017, it was announced, and a spin-off film, Rogue One, starring Oscar nominee Felicity Jones, will debut in December 2016, shortly after the release of the seventh episode, Star Wars: The Force Awakens.<br /></p> <p>Investors re-elected 10 board members at the meeting, including the chief executive, Bob Iger, who has led Disney through a blockbuster 2014 thanks to the popularity of Frozen and a good year for its theme parks. Iger, chief executive of the company since 2005 and chairman since 2012, received $43.7m in 2014, up 27% from the previous year. </p> <p>An attendee asked Iger whether Disney employees would also get a raise. He said that, after increasing basic pay to $10 an hour for employees covered by one of its largest unions, Disney has extended the commitment to all hourly employees.</p>","headline":"Frozen 2 announcement makes little Elsas – and Disney shares – jump for joy","trailText":"Josh Gad, who played snowman Olaf in original blockbuster, confirmed to return, with Idina Menzel and Kristin Bell also expected to join","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426221977471/058b3c20-77c3-48b7-bfb8-eae439c05841-140x84.png","wordcount":"586","commentable":"true","byline":"Nancy Groves and Lauren Gambino in New York","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-03-16T15:00:00+11:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/13/frozen-2-announcement-makes-little-elsas-and-disney-shares-jump-for-joy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/mar/13/frozen-2-announcement-makes-little-elsas-and-disney-shares-jump-for-joy","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/frozen","webTitle":"Frozen","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/frozen","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/frozen","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/walt-disney-company","webTitle":"Walt Disney Company","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/walt-disney-company","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/walt-disney-company","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film-industry","webTitle":"Film industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film-industry","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film-industry","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/animation","webTitle":"Animation","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/animation","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/animation","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","sectionName":"US news","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/business","sectionName":"Business","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/nancy-groves","webTitle":"Nancy Groves","r2ContributorId":"28698","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/19/1421674486181/Nancy-Groves.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/19/1421674503790/Nancy-Groves-R.png","firstName":"nancy","lastName":"groves","twitterHandle":"nancyarts","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Nancy is culture editor of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/au\">Guardian Australia</a>.

early milestone for Jack Thompson, Ken Hannam’s 1975 tale of salt-of-the-earth sheep shearers is a sobering portrait of life spent working for the weekend</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>The Australian film renaissance of the 1970s, lately dubbed the New Wave, brought a reinvigorated national cinema to local and overseas attention. The first of the New Wave features to find acclaim abroad was a hard yakka story about a bunch of salt-of-the-earth sheep shearers who congregate at a remote station to work, drink, sweat and battle their boss for a decent pay.</p> <p>That film, Sunday Too Far Away (1975), was a first on other fronts, too: the first Australian feature film to play in the director’s fortnight category at Cannes, the first to be produced by the South Australian Film Commission and the first for its director, Ken Hannam.</p> <p>It marks an early milestone in the career of the actor Jack Thompson, whose cachet as a fair dinkum alpha male would see him to return with numerous iterations of that role (and varying amounts of his facial hair) as the years progressed. Thompson plays Foley, a gun shearer circa 1956 who has held the record for the number of sheep sheared for a decade. He returns to work to give the job he’s good at one final crack before retirement, but loses his status to a rival colleague (Peter Cummins).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhRWLQNnqVc\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hhRWLQNnqVc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The trailer for Sunday Too Far Away.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sunday Too Far Away opens with that quintessential Australian image: a bright sun blazing in front of a yellow sky above a panorama of red dirt. On the ground Foley dozes off while driving his FJ Holden down a dusty road. The car topples several times before the protagonist emerges unscathed but a mite agitated.</p> <p>Foley discovers there is blood on his face (“bugger me”) then picks up his bag and walks into town. The film’s first interior is, of course, the pub. Foley doesn’t have to ask for a beer before a drink is poured and the bar lady is informed of his plans. “I’ve come back but I’m not gonna bust my gut. I’m gonna shear nice and steady,” he says. “Ease up on the grog. Put a little bit away.”</p> <p>At the shearing station the rest of the fellas are introduced, including an unpopular chef with an affection for lemon essence, and Foley’s roommate, an elderly alcoholic called Garth (Reg Lye). It doesn’t take long for the film’s staunchly pro-union pitch to kick in; the shearers um and ah about who their rep is (that job is forced on to Foley) but quickly rally for better conditions. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/aug/07/jack-thompson-i-was-adopted-by-the-yolngu-nation\">Jack Thompson: I was adopted by the Yolngu nation as their own son</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The men pass a motion prohibiting their boss from entering the premise (also, Foley has eyes on his daughter), laying the groundwork for a final act about taking a stand for workers’ rights. Most dramatically, the shearers fight the “scabs” sent to replace them. In the great blokey Australian knockabout spirit there’s a lot of shouting and a punch-up. But Hannam’s direction is also very close to his actors, and the wizened spirit of these men (the cast is terrific) leaves a lasting impression.</p> <p>The film’s title comes from a legendary lament reportedly from a shearer’s wife: “Friday night [he’s] too tired; Saturday night too drunk; Sunday, too far away.” Those final four words also match up to a broader reading of the film: its portrait of lives spent working for the weekend and the dispiriting emotions that entails. </p> <p>The work-life tussle is known by several labels: the rat race, taking care of business, working nine to five. While footage of Thompson and the boys shearing sheep in 50s clothes may feel a little like a time capsule these days, Sunday Too Far Away’s depiction of a sobering truth – that most of our lives are governed by need rather than choice – continue to make it relevant.<br /></p>","headline":"Sunday Too Far Away rewatched – hard yakka story of shearers and scabs","trailText":"An early milestone for Jack Thompson, Ken Hannam’s 1975 tale of salt-of-the-earth sheep shearers is a sobering portrait of life spent working for the weekend, writes <strong>Luke Buckmaster</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426208150877/99162dc4-967a-4518-b7db-f9497b6d67b0-140x84.png","wordcount":"630","commentable":"true","byline":"Luke Buckmaster","productionOffice":"AUS","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2015-03-16T12:00:00+11:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/13/sunday-too-far-away-rewatched-hard-yakka-story-of-shearers-and-scabs","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/mar/13/sunday-too-far-away-rewatched-hard-yakka-story-of-shearers-and-scabs","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/series/rewatching-classic-australian-films","webTitle":"Rewatching classic Australian films","description":"In this retrospective series we rewatch Australian films that have stood the test of time.","type":"series","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/rewatching-classic-australian-films","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/series/rewatching-classic-australian-films","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/australia","webTitle":"Australian film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/australia","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/australia","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/luke-buckmaster","webTitle":"Luke Buckmaster","r2ContributorId":"57812","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/10/15/1413372700044/Luke-Buckmaster.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/10/15/1413372718286/Luke-Buckmaster-L.png","firstName":"luke","lastName":"buckmaster","twitterHandle":"lukebuckmaster","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Luke Buckmaster is film critic and writer for Guardian Australia, and contributes commentary to a range of Australian publications.

superpowered maths brains. Asa Butterfield (the lead in Scorsese’s 2011 movie Hugo) plays Nathan, a teen maths star whose disorders are worsened by the death of his father, making him retreat into the comforting world of numbers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/mar/12/x-plus-y-video-review\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/46tvk\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2257004\"                data-video-name=\"X+Y - video review\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/3/12/1426173446976/crop_640x360.jpeg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-455871183\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/3/12/1426173442282/crop_1200x720.jpeg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/03/12/150312xplusy4_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/03/12/150312xplusy4_small.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/03/12/150312xplusy4.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10140174&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/03/12/150312xplusy4_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source> </video> <figcaption>X+Y - video review</figcaption> </figure>  <p>His mother – an intelligent, compassionate performance from Sally Hawkins – must deal with it all as best she can. But then a troubled school maths teacher (Rafe Spall) enters Nathan for the maths Olympiad and there he finds his unemotional world rocked by an even more brilliant, beautiful maths whiz from China: Zhang Mei (Jo Yang). It’s an engaging film with a nice supporting performance from Eddie Marsan as the Olympians’ team coach, though the Olympiad itself turns out to be, somewhat oppressively, just one big, glorified exam, and the narrative question of whether some things are more important than maths is only really broached at the end of the film. But this is an attractively unparochial drama with a bracing interest in excellence.</p>","headline":"X+Y review – a charming mathematical uncertainty","trailText":"Competitive maths + teenage romance

speaker sold me a cream and Froot Loops-based Mexican popsicle of his own creation called the Saturday Morning Cartoon. </p> <p>This mix of machismo, nostalgia and high-fructose hedonism is endemic to Austin, Texas, a town with a large college campus and tech industry jobs for the young and playful and their disposable incomes. Many local businesses may claim to be the “heart” of the city, but for film lovers it is undoubtedly the <a href=\"http://drafthouse.com/austin\">Alamo Drafthouse</a>, which just celebrated the 10th anniversary of its in-house film festival, <a href=\"http://fantasticfest.com/\">Fantastic Fest.<br /></a><br />Fantastic Fest specializes in extremes – this year the programming ranged from far-out Mexican science fiction to Norwegian psychological horror to a British documentary about slime molds to a lewd parody of the Italian “giallo” to a gangland hip-hop opera from Japan. There are always a handful of movies that are already en route to a release in mainstream cinemas, but for many these are the afterthoughts. </p> <p>The pride a Fantastic Fest-goer feels comes from seeing something so twisted and deranged the Chinese government won’t let it out of the country without strings attached. (A Fantastic Fest programmer told a tale of recruiting his girlfriend for translation duties to acquire one such film.) The extra-cinematic activities, frequently based in The Highball, a restaurant/bar/arcade/karaoke facility attached to the theater, similarly run the gamut. The same stage that hosted “Nerd Rap” featured an hourlong Q&amp;A with the charming elder statesman of cinephilia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Maltin\">Leonard Maltin</a>.</p> <p>While the organized trip to go off and fire shotguns may have just been pure Texas, most of the zany tie-ins have a thematic connection. An organized pie-fight after the repertory screening of Alan Parker’s Bugsy Malone makes perfect sense in context, as the 1976 film, which cast kid actors like Scott Baio and Jodie Foster as 1920s gangsters, swapped bullets for pie cream for the shootouts.<br />Catching an archival print of Bugsy Malone on a big screen with a top notch sound system was a personal highlight, and made for an amusing counterpoint to the debut of Keanu Reeves’ new action picture John Wick. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9151bf19-ced8-400a-9f40-3428fca5735f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/24/1411568564471/3b7b3477-73d5-484b-b898-b6eda05ac6e4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"John Wick\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reeves doesn’t act too much, but looks cool in his upcoming film John Wick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fantastic Fest</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Directed by former stuntmen David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, John Wick is a perfect vehicle for Reeves as he glides into the next phase of his career. Bluntly, he doesn’t have to act much, but he has to look cool wearing a suit while shooting people at close range with automatic weapons. As the titular character (the full name is repeated so many times that the drinking game is surely around the corner) Reeves is a former hit-man who just wants a quiet life. But when the bratty son of the Russian Mob (played by Game of Thrones’ Theon Greyjoy!) steals his car and kills his dog, the spirit of vengeance is unleashed. </p> <p>So far pretty standard, but when John Wick goes “back on the job” the movie takes a creative leap into satire and surrealism. We enter an underworld of contract killers and the service industry that caters to their trade. As such, John Wick has some of the best hotelier jokes in a movie since Neil Simon’s Plaza Suite. This tweak at realism gives the movie a little extra wiggle room, and as such the extreme violence comes off as strangely charming. John Wick is not the direct-to-DVD feature you’d suspect from the poster.<br />Another debuting film that made a splash was Isaac Ezban’s The Incident (El Incidente). I know this doesn’t sound like an endorsement, but it’s been a while since I’ve witnessed the uncomfortable confusion and frustration that accompany nightmares put to film in such a way. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e4a5d00c-903d-4b8a-bd2f-b7a434fe2c05\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/24/1411578015093/1ff010ed-4f82-4ee0-9b3e-99c775a0480c-460x276.png\" alt=\"Fantastic Fest The Incident\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The Incident isn’t a graphic or violent movie, but a gripping psychological torture session.’ </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fantastic Fest</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Incident isn’t a graphic or violent movie, but a gripping psychological torture session. Until its revelatory ending it seems like two not-very-connected Twilight Zone stories. In one, a cop and two thuggish brothers (one shot in the leg) are trapped in a stairwell. In the other, a family with a sick child is on a road trip that offers no exits. The simple “what if?” scenarios play out in ways that seem ludicrous at first, but jibe with the film’s peculiar internal logic. The production design and world building are extraordinary, especially considering that the movie was most likely made on a minuscule budget. This is Mexican director Isaac Ezban’s first feature film, and I can’t wait to see what he’s got in store next.</p> <p>Additional highlights include films that may have made their debut elsewhere, like the just-wrapped Toronto film festival, but perhaps needed a more likeminded venue to cut above the chatter. One such title was Tokyo Tribe, Sian Sono’s relentless rap-battle martial arts epic set in fantasy land of violent, warring crews. If The Warriors were rebooted as an absurdist live-action anime musical with lots of foulmouth humor and nudity, you’d have the soil ready to grow such a film. </p> <p>I’m not going to lie and say this movie is good, but considering the Drafthouse brings beer directly to the table and encourages hootin’ and hollerin’ when diminutive and adorably clad women suddenly reveal themselves to be furious henchmen-destroying ass-kickers, it’s fair to say everyone had a really good time. Some of the raps had key phrases in English, so hundreds of giddy cinema-goers exited the screening chanting “Tokyo Tribe, never ever die!” as they made their way back to the bar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1098b1e9-fab9-4999-92cb-73df4c68c793\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/25/1411654355817/e53c4fc2-80f1-4e41-b3d3-bbeefa4672b9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tokyo Tribe\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tokyo Tribe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fantastic Fest</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br />Another Toronto premiere that popped up was Spring, a bizarre romantic drama that takes a left turn into monster mythology. “HP Lovecraft’s Before Sunrise” is how some were summarizing. The sweet, sincere and scary picture (from film-making team Benson &amp; Moorehead) had the good fortune to announce an acquisition deal at the fest – from the Alamo Drafthouse’s distribution arm Drafthouse Films. Those not in the know may think that a theater chain specializing in bringing queso dip and suds directly to your seat has no business in distributing films, but in just four years they’ve had two pictures nominated for Academy Awards (Belgian crime tale Bullhead and the Indonesian documentary The Act of Killing.)<br />From elsewhere in the fest, I was quite taken with the The Creeping Garden, a look at the mysterious world of slime molds (really) from both a scientific and artistic point of view. The movie hums as if it was shot by aliens visiting Earth for the first time, and that’s a high compliment. I also enjoyed watching hardcore cinephiles react to Peter Strickland’s The Duke of Burgundy and Miroslav Slaboshpytskiy’s The Tribe. The first is a stylized but ultimately tender tale of a May-December lesbian BDSM romance set in a world without men, and the second is a Ukrainian film set at a school for the deaf that doubles as a prostitution headquarters. The Tribe, shot in long, wide takes, is entirely in sign language without subtitles.

In both fiction and non-fiction, climate change is no longer depicted as the eventual cause of future calamity, but a reality affecting everyday life. <br /></p> <p>On the heels of documentaries that hoped to raise awareness by laying out the facts about climate change have come new ones showing the consequences of our behavior through spectacular images of an increasingly inhospitable environment. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/114266/inconvenient.truth\">An Inconvenient Truth</a>, that PowerPoint presentation of a documentary from 2006, stands as a prototype of activist filmmaking, the kind of movie that caused Roger Ebert to write, apparently for the first time in his career, “you owe it to yourself to see this film.” </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4c55d78c-f5a3-4e1b-9247-9bacff0ab8de\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/19/1411156348437/ee785cf9-83ed-42db-9585-80c3dbc818e8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"An Inconvenient Truth.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">“Gore leads viewers with calm determination through facts and figures, laying out the problem at hand”</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Paramount</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It bets on the power of reason: Gore leads viewers with calm determination through facts and figures, laying out the problem at hand. ‘How can you ignore the truth?’, the film seems to ask.<br /></p> <p>Years later, it seems Gore’s ‘truth-telling’ hasn’t been as successful as he’d hoped, and a series of more recent docs have broached new ways of approaching the issue. </p> <p>James Balog’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/13/chasing-ice-review\">Chasing Ice</a> is no less eager to change the mindset and behavior of its audience than Inconvenient Truth; in fact, Balog explicitly states at the beginning that he is former climate change skeptic who has now seen the light, positioning his film as a hopeful catalyst for other similar transformations. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZTMVNBjc4\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eIZTMVNBjc4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>But Balog is also a photographer by trade, and his approach is correspondingly more visual than Guggenheim’s in Inconvenient Truth: the doc follows him and his crew as they trek into the Arctic and produce multi-year timelapse videos that dramatically show the melting of ice caps and glaciers. Inconvenient Truth, of course, also had photos displaying similar evidence, but Balog’s images go much further. </p> <p>Beyond eliciting understanding, they’re clearly produced to inspire awe. </p> <p>The images that Edward Burtynsky and Jennifer Baichwal produce in their documentary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/04/watermark-review-documentary-jennifer-baichwal\">Watermark</a> are equally striking. Unlike Chasing Ice, Watermark is not exclusively concerned with climate change. Its focus is on water in general, the ways we live with it, use it in religious worship, and attempt to control it. </p> <p>There’s certainly a romanticizing element to the film; Like Balog, Burtynsky is a photographer and much of the doc shows him taking wondrous shots of environmental landscapes—of sprawling farmland, rivers, and rice terraces. But knowing what we do about climate change, the images of these locales carry a spectral warning of their vulnerability.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvarPeJpkM\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpvarPeJpkM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>In a sense, then, Watermark takes for granted a certain amount of environmental awareness. It certainly places climate change within a larger panorama of issues, which is the same thing that many recent narrative films have done. </p> <p>Most often, climate change appears in fictional movies like The Day After Tomorrow, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/20/snowpiercer-first-look-review-edinburgh-2014\">Snowpiercer</a>, or – remarkably ahead of its time – Waterworld as a set-up or explanation for disaster. In films like Night Moves and Beasts of the Southern Wild, though, it becomes a basic fact of the world we live in. </p> <p>The two movies are miles apart in tone: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/01/venice-film-festival-night-moves-review\">Night Moves</a> is a low-key thriller about three environmental activists planning to bomb a dam in Oregon; <em>Beasts</em> is an exuberant quasi-fantasy set in an isolated Louisiana community as it prepares for, and then deals with the aftermath of a large storm. </p> <p>Yet in their own ways—whether by realistically profiling characters determined to force decreased consumption or by magically positing the existence of a raging band of aurochs, thawed out after centuries of captivity in the Arctic ice caps – both offer stories that sense that the end of Gore’s 10-year warning approaches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5U4TtYpKIc\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5U4TtYpKIc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>In that respect, perhaps the best film we have about climate change is Jeff Nichols’s Take Shelter. Much like the 2008 remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still, but with more compelling results, Take Shelter signals how climate change has become our equivalent to the mid-20th century nuclear scare. The movie tells the story of Curtis, who begins having visions of deadly storms and, to the dismay of his family, proceeds to spend all his time and money building a storm shelter. </p> <p>As a film about contemporary anxieties, Curtis’s visions could symbolize a number of fears, but it’s not hard to tell which is the most pressing and obvious one. Throughout the film, Curtis repeats his warnings, continues his plans, and his demeanor in doing so can only be described as paranoid. Yet we all live with the prospect of similar threats and what’s most worrisome, then, is how we seem a little less crazy every new day that we repeat them.</p>","headline":"After An Inconvenient

no way around this: The November Man is impenetrable and not even Pierce Brosnan can save this absurdist action flick</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>There’s no way around this: The November Man is asinine. It is not without its pleasures – if you like seeing people get hit in the face with shovels, that is – but it might be the most irresponsibly dumb spy thriller I’ve seen in some time. It seems we can’t go a week without another mid-budget action film from a slew of international producers, a recognizable face out front practically bullying us to make a <a href=\"http://www.redbox.com/\">Redbox</a> rental. (Holding a gun and scowling usually reduces me to “yes, sir” obedience.) Unlike the Expendables or Getaway or any number of Nicolas Cage flicks, you can at least rationalize that this one is a slight cut above the others. If those are McDonald’s and Burger King, this one is at least The Olive Garden – it’s no less recycled, but the existence of a cloth napkin allows for the facade of decency.</p> <p>This film’s cloth napkin comes in the form of Pierce Brosnan. He who began his career as a fake James Bond on TV’s Remington Steele and then inherited 007’s license to kill during the franchise’s leaner years is, one cannot deny, a welcome and charismatic face up there on the big screen. Even when he’s galumphing through a screenplay that is simultaneously impenetrable and horribly rote. That’s a neat storytelling trick, so let me shed a little light on the actual plot of this idiotic movie. You may want to grab a shot of espresso for this next paragraph.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7854f1c8-92f2-44ff-9706-f4c3e7e22d22\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/28/1409235741379/89fa9c0a-0c30-4026-84a7-5fba356ffbb9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"november man pierce brosnan olga kurylenko\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pierce Brosnan and Olga Kurylenko. Photograph: Aleksandar Letic/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peter Devereaux (Brosnan) gets results! He’s the best the CIA’s got, but after an op in Montenegro goes wrong, he leaves the agency to live in Switzerland. But now there’s a new threat – a real gross bad guy who is about to become the elected president of Russia! Someone on the inside has the goods to take this creep down and she needs to get extracted through Belgrade – and the only one who can do it is Devereaux.</p> <p>Well, guess what happens: things don’t go as planned. Do you think the people in high places that were originally trustworthy turn out, in fact, to be working toward a nefarious end? Or how about people who seem, at first, to be bad guys – might they, at the end of the day, do what’s right? I know you are sitting there, quaking in suspense to find out the answer.</p> <p>These hackneyed devices would be fine if the movie had anything to say or, at the very least, a jazzy way of not saying anything. The movie, alas, has neither. It has dull action set pieces, leaden dialogue, lots of running around Belgrade (making very little use of location photography) and endless Skype calls. There are some headfakes toward themes about how the act of killing leads to an irredeemable life, and there’s some father-son stuff between Brosnan and his former protégé played by Australian Luke Bracey, but these are fleeting whiffs. The movie only excels in its sound design department – an inordinate amount of people get bonked with pipes, fire extinguishers and full beer kegs in this one. Most likely because that’s cheap to film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f0a56d6f-5f11-4d2d-aa7e-78b2311f3ae1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/28/1409234726442/20866bdb-b030-456c-afc7-6efd7e18cae4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Olga Kurylenko november man\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The movie reduces Kurylenko’s character to a mere damsel that needs to be saved by a Hollywood-approved Anglo Saxon male. Photograph: Aleksandar Letic /AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the middle of all this noise is a doe-eyed Chechen refugee played by Olga Kurylenko, and the movie finds plenty of opportunities to insultingly slap her down. First, the Second Chechen War is reduced to a silly plot point to scoot our backstory along. (Spoiler: turns out the root causes of this complex international tragedy is really just due to one man’s megalomaniacal movement of puppet strings.) Then, to make matters worse, when she finally has the fiend who killed her family and raped her all through her childhood in her clutches, Brosnan (and, by extension, the movie) reduces her once again to a mere damsel that needs to be saved by a Hollywood-approved Anglo Saxon male. Despicable. (More sexism abounds in this odious picture. Even though he’s a baddie, one character’s frequent reference to a female underling as either “tits” or “twat” is played for laughs. It isn’t funny.)</p> <p>Director <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002044/\">Roger Donaldson</a> has made some terrific movies in the past (The Bounty, Thirteen Days) so I spent much of the film’s running time trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. A recurring motif is how young Luke Bracey can never catch Brosnan because he taught the kid everything he knows. This manifests itself in two scenes – one, a chase through a marketplace as the two trade barbs via cellphones, and the other where Brosnan nearly kills an innocent woman to test his former apprentice’s reflexes. I thought, for a moment, that this signaled a tipping point where the movie would show that the life of a killer had driven Brosnan past the point of redemption. But ... not really. Bracey’s young paramour, who gets three lines in the movie (but does get fully naked) has her femoral artery brutally sliced and is now scarred for the rest of the movie, all to show what a badass our hero is. The phrase “what the hell were they thinking?” comes to mind.</p> <p>The film does end “up,” with a bloody kill-spree that is, if nothing else, energetic. The audience packed with winners of a free ticket giveaway stopped talking amongst themselves for those scenes and seemed to have a good time.</p>","headline":"The November Man – first look review: an asinine and horribly rote screenplay","trailText":"There’s no way around this: The November Man is asinine and not even Pierce Brosnan can save this absurdist action flick","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/28/1409235651485/22f37864-fa1d-4786-ae76-6f8c3cecf400-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"922","commentable":"true","starRating":"2","byline":"Jordan Hoffman","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-31T11:15:00-04:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/28/the-november-man-pierce-brosnan-first-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/aug/28/the-november-man-pierce-brosnan-first-review","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/the-november-man","webTitle":"The November Man","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-november-man","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/the-november-man","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/series/first-look-review","webTitle":"First look review","description":"Early reviews from film festivals and advance previews","type":"series","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/first-look-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/series/first-look-review","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/pierce-brosnan","webTitle":"Pierce Brosnan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/pierce-brosnan","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/pierce-brosnan","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/actionandadventure","webTitle":"Action and adventure","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/actionandadventure","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/actionandadventure","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jordan-hoffman","webTitle":"Jordan Hoffman","r2ContributorId":"64308","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/23/1403542588719/Jordan-Hoffman-profile-pi-003.jpg","firstName":"jordan","lastName":"hoffman","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jordan Hoffman is a writer and critic based in New York City.

comedy stars Gaby Hoffmann as pregnant woman who goes into a paranoid fantasy when her first child dies</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>The creators of indie horror comedy Lyle will offer the film online for free next week, in an unusual bid to raise funding for the second in a planned trilogy of female-driven horror films.</p> <p>Lyle, billed as “a lesbian Rosemary’s Baby”, stars indie darling Gaby Hoffmann as a pregnant lesbian whose first child dies while she is pregnant with her second, causing the character to snap out of her idyllic life in an extreme way. “She sort of goes into an uncertain state of mind – a paranoid fantasy world trying to figure out what happened,” Hoffmann told The Guardian.</p> <p>Stewart Thorndike, a New York-based filmmaker and friend of Hoffmann’s, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/magazine/gaby-hoffmann-the-eloise-of-the-chelsea-hotel.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">wrote the Leah character for Hoffmann</a>. Thorndike and producer Alex Acharfman decided to post the film online for free on 4 August to support Thorndike’s trifecta of female-driven horror films. Lyle will be online for the duration of a Kickstarter campaign that seeks to raise money for The Putney School, the second film in Stewart’s trio, which is about a haunted TED talk.<br /></p> <p>Hoffmann spoke to the Guardian from a television shoot in Los Angeles for the Amazon series <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/02/jill-soloway-on-her-amazon-pilot-transparent.html\">Transparent</a>, a comedy-drama which follows a family after the patriarch comes out as transgender. It’s the latest project for a one-time child star (Field of Dreams, Sleepless in Seattle) who as an adult has cemented herself as a classic independent film star with roles on television series Girls and films like Crystal Fairy and The Magic Cactus.<br /></p> <p>Hoffmann said she last saw a horror film when she was a kid, but chose the role because of the challenges it presented for her as an actress.<br /></p> <p>“I’m not that interested in horror films, I never have been. I don’t quite get the appeal,” Hoffmann said. “But as an actress, it seemed like a really, fun, juicy role to take on and it really was – I had a lot of fun making it, certainly.”<br /></p> <p>Most of the film was shot in one building, in five days. “You’re sort of in that world 24/7,” Hoffmann said. “You’re living breathing, eating it. It’s exhausting, but I kind of enjoy working that way, because you sort of merge with this false reality that you are trying to create.”<br /></p> <p>While Hoffmann enjoys the intense, problem-solving environment low budget films offer, she’s open to good storytelling on any level.<br /></p> <p>“What I prefer is good writing and smart people,” Hoffmann said. “Wherever that is found, and that is found all over the place in terms of budget, that’s where I tend to want to be.”</p>","headline":"Lyle: the 'lesbian Rosemary's Baby' to be streamed for free online","trailText":"Horror comedy stars Gaby Hoffmann as pregnant woman who goes into a paranoid fantasy when her first child dies","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/30/1406739355511/9da36277-b3cc-4fb3-bf2a-7a5c058ea767-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"427","commentable":"true","byline":"Amanda Holpuch","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-08-02T13:00:00-04:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/30/lyle-horror-comedy-gaby-hoffman-online-free","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/30/lyle-horror-comedy-gaby-hoffman-online-free","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/filmblog","webTitle":"Film blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","sectionName":"US news","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/horror","webTitle":"Horror","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/horror","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/horror","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/amanda-holpuch","webTitle":"Amanda Holpuch","r2ContributorId":"50290","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/25/1411659882620/Amanda-Holpuch.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/25/1411659899648/Amanda-Holpuch-R.png","firstName":"amanda","lastName":"holpuch","twitterHandle":"holpuch","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Amanda is a reporter at the Guardian.</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-holpuch","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/amanda-holpuch","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"_no_ids","relation":"main","type":"embed","assets":[{"type":"embed","file":"http://vimeo.com/101746779","typeData":{"source":"Vimeo","description":"This is \"LYLE trailer // FREE on LYLEmovie.com // AUGUST 4th\" by Stewart Thorndike on Vimeo, the home for high quality videos and the people who love them.","height":"259","credit":"Stewart Thorndike","caption":"‘I’m not that interested in horror films, I never have been.

One thing was different, though: we didn&apos;t go to the movies. This holiday weekend took a 44% dip in American ticket sales from 2013. If you adjust for inflation it was the worst 4 July weekend since 1987.</p> <p>The capability to stream TV and movies (legally and otherwise) is reminding studios that their product needs to be enticing enough to warrant the time and expense of a theater visit. Last weekend&apos;s openers Tammy and Deliver Us From Evil were pretty much reviled by most critics. With the summer halfway done, is there anything good on the horizon?</p> <p>Unfortunately, the answer is: not much. It isn&apos;t all bleak, but compared to the summers of our youth (and it isn&apos;t just nostalgia: the 80s and 90s really knew how to pack a season of blockbusters) it&apos;s a desert out there. Below are the very few oases for filmgoers between now and Labor Day, with US release dates listed.</p> <h2>Big movies that will be good</h2> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-film\">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</a> (11 July)</b><br /></p> <p>“Who asked for this?” I snarked as I entered the theater during 2011&apos;s Rise of the Planet of the Apes. “Buck, I will avenge thee!” I wept as the film ended. Rise began a little hokey, and no one is going to accuse Freida Pinto of giving a good performance, but take state-of-the-art motion capturing, ambiguous moral culpability, a few bananas and you have a thrilling action film. The sequel, Dawn, takes place after society&apos;s downfall as Caesar (once again a computer-enhanced Andy Serkis) leads his simian armies through war and peace. The film, like some of the original Apes movies, mixes intellect and allegory with adventure and special effects. A number of critics have already applauded Matt Reeves, best known for directing Cloverfield, for delivering an Empire Strikes Back-level entertainment for this new trilogy. (Yep: the third instalment has already been greenlit.)</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155488/guardians-of-the-galaxy\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> (1 August)</b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIQ2-PZBC8\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LIQ2-PZBC8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is Marvel Studio head Kevin Feige&apos;s victory lap. When The Avengers became the third highest grossing picture ever, the bean counters at Disney shrugged and said, sure, take something from comic book lore out for a spin. Thus we get director James Gunn, whose last film was the anti-superhero picture Super, tackling the weirdest collection of deep cut oddities in Marvel canon. Guardians of the Galaxy features Bradley Cooper as a gun-toting, talking raccoon, and Vin Diesel as a sentient tree creature from Planet X. This more resembles the 80s space adventure The Ice Pirates than Captain America. Chris Pratt as the rogueish leader and Zoe Saldana (green this time, not blue) zip around in cool ships saving the day, zinging each other with jokes. I must confess, I&apos;ve been keeping my head in the sand on this one, trying to avoid too much specific info. I love nerdy superhero sci-fi, and once I saw the soundtrack was wall-to-wall 70s pop (10cc! Jackson 5! The Raspberries!) I cut myself off from watching any clips. A critic can still be a fan.</p> <h2>Big movies that will be dumb but maybe fun (Maybe)</h2> <p><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(2014_film)\">Hercules</a> (25 July)</b></p> <p>This movie will be bad. Director Brett Ratner is basically the poor man&apos;s Michael Bay. But Dwayne Johnson is a charisma machine. If I said to you I didn&apos;t want to see him shirtlessly accomplishing his heroic twelve labors I&apos;d be a liar. Plus, this movie co-stars Ian McShane, who is either Al Swearengin or Emperor Palpatine. I get the two confused, but they&apos;re both great, so whichever it is, we win.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872732/\">Lucy</a> (25 July)</b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVt32qoyhi0\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MVt32qoyhi0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My anticipation of Lucy is much the same as Hercules. Director Luc Besson&apos;s name on a project has lately become the kiss of death for actual quality, but he does tend to deliver a certain kind of good time. Lucy features Scarlett Johansson running around Taipei making time stop and people fly across the room, and she probably wears sexy wigs and says quotable things in that deep voice of hers, before shots of a gorgeous stunt double spins around like a human top. Listen: I live in New York City and by 25 July it is so disgustingly hot that the air conditioning of a movie theater is a very real necessity. Watching ScoJo beat the crap out of baddies is more than adequate accompaniment for a good session of climate control.<br /></p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1924435/\">Let&apos;s Be Cops</a> (13 August)</b></p> <p>Damon Wayans and Jake Johnson play two dinguses who dress like cops for a costume party and discover that people treat them with respect. So they continue to pretend to be cops. Shenanigans ensue. Any premise this simple is just a little bit genius. I confess to laughing at the trailer.</p> <h2>Small movies that will be great</h2> <p>Listen up, you rubes. You don&apos;t have to just see what the rich monsters in Hollywood force-feed you through the studio system. What about the rich monsters producing lower-budget films? Keep your eyes peeled for these titles coming out during the second part of the summer. </p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1065073/\">Boyhood</a> (11 July)</b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jul/08/boyhood-richard-linklater-ellar-coltrane-interview-video\"                                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2121591\"                data-video-name=\"Richard Linklater and Ellar Coltrane on Boyhood: 'You're collaborating with an unknown future' – video interviews\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/7/4/1404486226273/Boyhood-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-441294572\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/7/4/1404486222754/Boyhood-008.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/07/04/140704Boyhood-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/07/04/140704Boyhood/140704Boyhood.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/07/04/140704Boyhood_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/07/04/140704Boyhood_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/07/04/140704Boyhood.webm\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Something of a minor miracle. Director Richard Linklater shot this movie in small doses over 12 years, slowly chronicling a young boy&apos;s maturation. It&apos;s a big movie made up of small moments, genuinely touching and wholly unpredictable. Get on the bandwagon now, as every critic worth his or her salt will list it on their end-of-year top 10.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2027140/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Mood Indigo</a> (18 July)<br /></b></p> <p>Arguably the most French movie ever made, Romain Duris and Audrey Tautou are quite adorable as fairy tale lovers in Michel Gondry&apos;s adaptation of Boris Vian&apos;s Froth on the Daydream. This highly energetic picture isn&apos;t for everyone – but if you like your whimsical magical realism done up in an antic, extra-crafty style, this may just win your heart.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2870756/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Magic in the Moonlight</a> (25 July)</b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAwbwKURvm0\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LAwbwKURvm0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The latest from Woody Allen is something of a small gem, with Colin Firth and Emma Stone sauntering through a 1930s-era Côte d&apos;Azur, saying witty things about magic and love and faith. Many of Allen&apos;s films have been set in an earlier era, few actually feel this much like an actual relic. In this case, it is meant as a high compliment.<br /></p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2234003/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Calvary</a> (1 August)</b></p> <p>Writer-director John Michael McDonough and actor Brendan Gleeson re-team for this funny yet melancholy look at the proverbial “good Irish priest” and a small village of idiosyncratic characters – one of which has pledged to murder Gleeson in a week&apos;s time. Chris O&apos;Down, Domhnall Gleeson, Isaach de Bankolé and Aidan Gillen co-star.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194328/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">Finding Fela!</a> (1 August)</b></p> <p>Director Alex Gibney pumps out documentaries like Wendy&apos;s chicken sandwiches, but there&apos;s no possible way to screw this up. Even if the talking heads are a snooze, any archival footage of Fela Kuti performing will make this a must-see.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1605717/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Frank</a> (15 August)</b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/may/07/frank-domhnall-gleeson-jon-ronson-video-interview\"                                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2088400\"                data-video-name=\"Frank star Domhnall Gleeson and co-writer Jon Ronson: 'We're not very forgiving of transgressions any more' – video interview\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/5/7/1399468086126/Frank-star-Domhnall-Glees-014.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-436250522\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/5/7/1399468084591/Frank-star-Domhnall-Glees-013.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/05/07/140507Frank-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/05/07/140507Frank_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/05/07/140507Frank_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/05/07//140507Frank.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/05/07/140507Frank/140507Frank.m3u8\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Loosely based on essayist Jon Ronson&apos;s youthful exploits as a keyboard player for Frank Sidebottom&apos;s band, this surreal rock comedy featuring Michael Fassbender in an enormous papier mâché head is a touching and sincere look at mental illness and the dangers of perceived genius. The last five minutes make for quite possibly the best finish in any film this year.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2581244/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">Life After Beth</a> (15 August)</b></p> <p>Aubrey Plaza deserves to be a bigger star, and maybe this horror-comedy is the one that will make it happen. Dane DeHaan, John C Reilly, Molly Shannon and a lot of other people you recognize co-star in this story of a wiseacre girl who becomes a zombie. (Now&apos;s when you reread the title and realize its genius.)</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1821641/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">The Congress</a> (29 August)</b></p> <p>Israeli director Ari Folman&apos;s follow-up to the politically charged Waltz With Bashir is a strange mix of Hollywood satire and psychedelic sci-fi mind trip. It begins as a satire on advancements in cinematic technology, then morphs down an animated rabbit hole of delusion and addiction. It&apos;s also virtually impossible to sum up, but if you like far-out “head” films you&apos;ll miss this one at your peril.</p>","headline":"Summer film preview: what do we have to look forward to?","trailText":"With the summer halfway done, we take a look at upcoming releases from Michel Gondry to Dawn of the Planet of the Apes","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/8/1404828277205/756a353c-7883-4ab6-82f6-142f4a27736a-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1350","commentable":"true","byline":"Jordan Hoffman","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-07-11T10:15:00-04:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/08/us-summer-movies-preview-planet-of-apes","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jul/08/us-summer-movies-preview-planet-of-apes","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-film","webTitle":"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","sectionName":"US news","references":[]},{"id":"film/lucy","webTitle":"Lucy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/lucy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/lucy","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/boyhood","webTitle":"Boyhood","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/boyhood","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/boyhood","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/michel-gondry","webTitle":"Michel Gondry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/michel-gondry","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/michel-gondry","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/magic-in-the-moonlight","webTitle":"Magic in the Moonlight","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/magic-in-the-moonlight","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/magic-in-the-moonlight","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/calvary","webTitle":"Calvary","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/calvary","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/calvary","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/frank","webTitle":"Frank","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/frank","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/frank","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/analysis","webTitle":"Analysis","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/analysis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/analysis","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jordan-hoffman","webTitle":"Jordan Hoffman","r2ContributorId":"64308","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/23/1403542588719/Jordan-Hoffman-profile-pi-003.jpg","firstName":"jordan","lastName":"hoffman","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jordan Hoffman is a writer and critic based in New York City.

This matter-of-fact indie romance highlights the pro-life message that Hollywood has been feeding its audience for decades</p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/19/sundance-film-festival-2014-obvious-child-review\">Obvious Child is a movie about a girl who gets an abortion</a> and lives happily ever after. In the real world, this is a familiar story – an obvious story, even. Thousands of women get abortions every year, feel fine about it, then move on with their lives. It’s a “big issue” for society that is sometimes, really, not that big of a deal. Yet in films and on TV, this is still largely uncharted, controversial territory. Though at first glance Obvious Child might seem like just a cute indie rom-com, its release has highlighted the pro-life messages that Hollywood has been feeding audiences for decades.</p> <p>Obvious Child was written and directed by Gillian Robespierre and stars Jenny Slate (from Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation). Slate plays Donna, a 28-year-old stand-up comedian in New York who, after being dumped by her boyfriend, sleeps with a guy who is not her type – a preppy Mr Nice. After what she thought was a one-night-stand turns into an accidental pregnancy, the story explores the difficult, and at times comic, reality of dealing with an abortion.</p> <p>In Hollywood, even in the ‘liberal’ world of independent film, unwanted pregnancies usually result in the woman deciding to have the child. Last month, on The Colbert Report, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/apr/04/ellen-page-interview\">Juno star Ellen Page</a> argued against the idea that the film has a pro-life message: <strong>“</strong>It’s very much a pro-choice film because Juno explores her options, she thinks about it, she goes to an abortion clinic.<strong>”</strong> But I think most would disagree. Despite Juno not being morally opposed to abortion, the message was clear: she couldn’t go through with it and ultimately felt it was a better decision to have the kid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cabI_CzXGD4\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cabI_CzXGD4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Obvious Child doesn’t do that familiar heartwarming thing. Instead, many women will relate to the sarcastic realism with which Donna handles her pregnancy. And while some of the comedy in Obvious Child falls flat, the film’s message is something to be applauded: having an abortion is not likely to ruin your life, or even be an awful experience; in fact, it might just all work out fine<strong>.</strong></p> <p>In light of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/03/arizona-abortion-restrictions-lawsuit-challenged\">many abortion restrictions</a> and new anti-abortion laws being passed across America, which are jeopardizing women’s reproductive rights, and in some states setting back the situation of women by decades, the movie’s release feels timely. One of the its best scenes is a conversation between Donna and her friend Nellie (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/09/gaby-hoffmann-child-star-who-broke-the-rules\">Gaby Hoffmann</a>), who has previously had an abortion herself. When Donna asks Nellie about her experience, she answers matter-of-factly: “I never regret it.” Later, when Donna is debating whether to tell her one-night-stand about the pregnancy, Nellie is adamant that it’s Donna’s body, and therefore Donna’s decision to make. She adds, in what may be the film’s strongest line, “We already live in a patriarchal society where a group of weird old white men in robes get to legislate our cunts.”</p> <p>No sane woman is excited about getting an abortion. It is something you hope never to have to do. And yet, speaking from experience, an abortion can also result in a wonderful feeling of relief for someone who is not ready to be a parent. When Donna has gone through the procedure, there is a scene that perfectly illustrates that complicated mix of feelings. Sitting in a room full of women in their 20s and 30s, all wearing pink hospital gowns, Donna looks rough. She turns to the woman beside her and they share a quick, genuine smile – they are both grateful.</p> <p>• Comments have been reopened to time with this film’s Australian release</p>","headline":"'Abortion rom-com' Obvious Child is important – because it's so ordinary","trailText":" This matter-of-fact indie romance highlights the pro-life message that Hollywood has been feeding its audience for decades","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/12/1402604265160/92ad268f-e4b1-40a1-9890-f9ad3b25498e-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"601","commentable":"true","byline":"Karley Sciortino","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-10-13T00:00:00+11:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/12/obvious-child-rom-com-jenny-slate-ordinary","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jun/12/obvious-child-rom-com-jenny-slate-ordinary","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/comedy","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/romance","webTitle":"Romance","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/romance","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/romance","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"world/abortion","webTitle":"Abortion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/abortion","sectionName":"World news","references":[]},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women","type":"keyword","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/women","sectionName":"Life and style","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/karley-sciortino","webTitle":"Karley Sciortino","r2ContributorId":"62943","firstName":"karley","lastName":"sciortino","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Karley Sciortino is a New York-based writer, filmmaker and actress, and author of the blog Slutever.

Stuart Heritage picks the best suggestions and imagines what they might entail<br></p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>Last week, fuelled by the prospect of watching a real film called Zombeavers, we set you <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/feb/14/can-you-come-up-with-a-better-b-movie-title-than-zombeavers\">an impossible task</a>. Could you, an average layperson, come up with a B-movie title even better than that? You didn’t let us down. In total, we received over 600 entries. Well done, everyone.</p> <p>Obviously, not all of them were great. About a third of them were slightly lazy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/113997/snakes.on.a.plane\">Snakes on a Plane</a> rip-offs (including but not limited to Goat on a Boat, Lambs on a Tram and Komodo Dragons on a Funicular Railway). Then, in true Guardian comment section fashion, there was also a smattering of borderline-incomprehensible political screeds shoehorned into catastrophic anti-puns, such as The Bourne Liar (starring Barack Obama), Attack of the Farrage and Cleggiband: Return of the Economy Killers. And then there were those that actually had promise. I now present the best five, along with the plots I think they deserve. If these are yours, congratulations. You win nothing.</p> <h2>Bearacuda! (as suggested by naughtyorator)</h2> <p>Realistically, what let <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U87zVkIXNI0http://\">Sharktopus</a> down was the fact that both sharks and octopuses are limited to water. Not so here. Bearacuda – the half-bear/half-fish result of a failed Russian experiment – can roam both land and sea, taking out scores of bikini-wearing minor actresses wherever they happen to be. Acclaimed sexy scientist Debbie Gibson leads a ragtag army of volunteers, equipped with harpoons and pots of honey, in a desperate effort to subdue Bearacuda before it kills again. Even though, in retrospect, she could have just waited until winter and stabbed it to death in its sleep.</p> <h2>The ExorShihTzu (as suggested by badcompany)</h2> <p>There’s a case for making The ExorShihTzu a film about a dog who gets possessed. But wouldn’t it be so much better to make the priests dogs instead? The Jason Miller priest could be a puppy, and the Max von Sydow priest could be an older, more experienced dog. In fact, why not just re-release <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/138749/exorcist\">The Exorcist</a>, but with those actors digitally erased and replaced with a couple of dogs? One of them could be voiced by Bruce Willis. It’d be fun. </p> <h2>Tiramisunami (as suggested by Blufog)</h2> <p>My favourite suggestion of all. Imagine – a Roland Emmerich-style disaster movie, but shot on a shoestring, starring a bunch of forgotten popstars from the 1980s and exclusively about pudding. A Russian experiment to drive Italy out of the cake business goes horribly awry, sending a 500ft shockwave of mascarpone and ladyfingers hurtling around the globe. After Micronesia is wiped off the face of the Earth entirely, acclaimed sexy scientist Shannen Doherty unveils her ambitious plans to build the world’s biggest spoon before the tiramisunami hits the eastern seaboard and makes a horrible sloppy mess out of the Statue of Liberty.</p> <h2>Vole-cano (as suggested by ID1300995)</h2> <p>Acclaimed sexy scientist Tara Reid has trouble convincing the UN of her latest theory – that science was wrong all along and that the Earth’s core is actually packed with voles – until a fissure opens in Toronto and sprays everyone with boiling hot voles. The president suggests blocking the hole with a big cork, but Reid knows better than this. This is why, backed by a ragtag gang of volunteers, she embarks on a life-or-death mission to the centre of the Earth to reason with the malevolent Vole King (voiced by Screech from Saved by the Bell).</p> <h2>We Fought a Zoo (as suggested by Stevenjameshyde)</h2> <p>Catastrophe. A failed Russian experiment has somehow unlocked all the cages of whichever zoo is nearest to the middle of Toronto, and now the animals have their minds set on bloody revenge. The mayor wants to use machine guns, but those no-good environmentalists won’t stop protesting. Meanwhile, retired heavyweight champion Carlton from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is on the brink of alcoholic suicide when he receives a mysterious text message – would he be willing to try and punch six tigers and an elephant unconscious with his bare hands and become a hero in the process? Note: for budgetary reasons, the action will be limited to one scene of Carlton kicking a furry snood into a well.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/feb/14/can-you-come-up-with-a-better-b-movie-title-than-zombeavers\">• Full list of your suggestions here</a></p>","headline":"After Zombeavers, five more monster movies we'd like to see","trailText":"We asked readers to come up with titles for new B-movies that could rival the unimprovable Zombeavers. <b>Stuart Heritage</b> picks the best suggestions and imagines what they might entail<br>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/19/1392809156207/c2986e69-f458-445a-97af-5aac16d424b8-140x84.png","wordcount":"691","commentable":"true","byline":"Stuart Heritage","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-02-26T00:00:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/feb/19/zombeavers-five-more-monster-movies","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2014/feb/19/zombeavers-five-more-monster-movies","sectionName":"Film","tags":[{"id":"film/horror","webTitle":"Horror","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/horror","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/horror","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"film/filmblog","webTitle":"Film blog","type":"blog","sectionId":"film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog","sectionName":"Film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","sectionName":"Culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","webTitle":"Blogposts","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-91d5da5e-2825-4e68-8392-034172d1b16a","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/19/1392809155299/6ca971ad-b505-4051-84f5-cd5368bd84a8-220x132.png","typeData":{"secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/19/1392809155299/6ca971ad-b505-4051-84f5-cd5368bd84a8-220x132.png","source":"YouTube","altText":"Still from Zombeavers trailer","height":"132","credit":"Photograph: YouTube","caption":"Beaver damnation … a still from the Zombeavers trailer.

Last week, the Secret Cinema organisation royally messed up the timing of its latest offering, a huge onsite theatricalised presentation of Robert Zemeckis's 1985 gem Back To The Future, in which Marty McFly, a feisty teen played by Michael J Fox, travels back in time to the 1950s, only to discover that his mom, now a total babe, has the hots for him.</p><p>The first week's performances had to be cancelled at short notice as the whole thing wasn't ready in time, resulting in social media fury and hundreds of disappointed punters forlornly wandering the east London streets in 50s dress.</p><p>Well, maybe Secret Cinema was having its Eric Stoltz moment: I like to think the delay was an elaborate postmodern joke about the fact that Back To The Future was originally cast with Stoltz in the lead role – an actor who was sacked after five weeks because he wasn't funny enough – and filming had to start all over again with Fox.</p><p>As a Secret Cinema virgin I found the event engaging and entertainingly bizarre: faux-American and yet very English in all its fancy-dress eccentricity. It isn't exactly an immersive, wraparound experience – you could get that better by seeing the film at an old-fashioned cinema showing. But it turned into an impressive festival of fan love, a Comic-Con-ish event in which so many audience members dressed up in 1950s clothes which were as authentic as those of the actors employed by the production, that everyone was a co-contributor: it was virtually a user-generated live event.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-443538760'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/31/1406847279069/secret2-008.jpg' alt='secret2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The stores glimpsed on screen are meticulously reconstructed – the Texaco gas station, the Hill Valley Telegraph office and the cinema showing Cattle Queen Of Montana.

The town hall itself, with its fatefully stopped clock, is a huge facade at one end – it forms the screen on which the film is shown – and the stores glimpsed on screen are meticulously reconstructed – the Texaco gas station, the JD Armstrong Realty office, the Hill Valley Telegraph office and the cinema showing Cattle Queen Of Montana with Ronald Reagan –  and stocked with period-specific stuff.</p><p>It was here that we milled around for a couple of hours before the movie began, looking in at the repro shops and queuing for ages for hot dogs and shakes. Not many were availing themselves of the freedom to smoke although there were a few vapers.</p><p>Bizarrely, while the site is still in daylight, buildings bearing names such as John Lewis and Westfield loom prominently and surreally over everything.

But the audiences at Toronto, which kicks off  on Thursday, will be clapping eyes on not one but two Adam Sandler movies: The Cobbler and Men, Women &amp; Children. That's the same Adam Sandler who played the dual roles of an advertising executive and his shrill twin sister in Jack and Jill, not to mention an Israeli commando turned Manhattan hairdresser (\"I just want to make people silky-smooth!\") in You Don't Mess with the Zohan.</p><p>However, this is a tale of two Sandlers. There is the goofy 47-year-old actor and writer whose sleepy chipmunk face and everyman demeanour give no hint of his estimated $300m (£180m)fortune – nor the $25m price-tag (including producer's fee) that comes with his participation on a movie.</p><p>His company, Happy Madison Productions, takes its name from a hybrid of two of his earliest hits (the 1995 back-to-school comedy Billy Madison and its golfing follow-up Happy Gilmore) and features in its logo the face of his late father, Stanley Sandler, a Brooklyn electrical engineer from Russian immigrant stock.</p><p>Recent successes for the company include Sandler's two Grown Ups movies, which between them earned more than $500m worldwide, as well as projects starring proteges such as Kevin James, whose Paul Blart: Mall Cop grossed $183m on a meagre $26m budget. All of which must make for an exceedingly Happy Madison.</p><p>The other Sandler is more unorthodox. Ever since he departed briefly from his own lucrative brand to star in Paul Thomas Anderson's skew-whiff rom-com Punch-Drunk Love in 2002, he has shown an occasional willingness to tamper and toy with his persona. In that film, he played a milquetoast whose rage issues emerge when he is exploited in a phone-sex scam. Perhaps it is the proximity of comedy and aggression (comics like to \"slay\" or \"kill\" their audiences, after all) that makes it strangely appropriate to see Sandler showing a more serious and volatile side.</p><p>Such an offbeat endeavour can't expect to enjoy much crossover potential with the Sandler fan base. But it does display a sense of adventure and dexterity seen in established comics chafing against their image.</p><p>Bill Murray co-wrote and starred in a 1984 adaptation of Somerset Maugham's The Razor's Edge – in the same year as Ghostbusters no less. Steve Martin couldn't have found a sharper contrast to his own loopy vaudevillian vehicles than the lead in the grim 1981 film version of Dennis Potter's Pennies From Heaven.</p><p>Similarly, Sandler proved in Punch-Drunk Love, and in other complex parts that pepper his CV (such as Reign Over Me, where he was a man who lost his family in the World Trade Centre attacks), that there is more to him than slapstick and fart jokes.</p><p>Early signs suggest the films unveiled in Toronto will enhance those complexities. In The Cobbler, Sandler plays a lonely shoe repairman who discovers that he can enter the lives of his customers via a magical heirloom – that he can know them by walking in their shoes. And in Men, Women &amp; Children, directed by Jason Reitman (Juno, Up in the Air), he and Emma Thompson are part of an ensemble cast portraying people whose relationships are affected by the internet. The Sandler faithful might want to sit these ones out and wait for Grown Ups 3.</p><p>Sandler earned his stripes in the early 1990s on the evergreen US sketch show Saturday Night Live. The director Dennis Dugan wanted to cast him in Brain Donors, a 1992 comedy based on the Marx brothers' A Night at the Opera. \"I thought Adam was terrifically funny, interesting and personable,\" Dugan says. \"I brought him in for four auditions but I just couldn't get the producers to say yes.\" A few years later, Sandler remembered Dugan's persistence and hired him to direct Happy Gilmore. \"He's completely loyal. He'll even stay loyal to people who aren't as good team-mates as you'd like them to be. That's his personality.\"</p><p>Dugan has directed eight of Sandler's movies, including the gay-themed I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, Just Go With It (co-starring Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman) and both Grown Ups pictures. But as far back as their initial collaboration, Dugan spotted an intriguing undercurrent in the star.</p><p>\"When we made Happy Gilmore I said to his agent and manager: 'He doesn't have to be just a goofball. He's got real heart and soul – he's a real actor. So we can go with the Pauly Shore version of this, or the Michael Keaton version.' They said they wanted the Michael Keaton version, and I did too.\"</p><p>Sandler became a one-man phenomenon; each hit outstripped the last. The Wedding Singer, in which he was a jilted groom performing 1980s pop hits and falling for Drew Barrymore, raked in $123m worldwide in 1998 and made a convincing case for him as a rom-com lead. In the same year, he was a nerd tormented by football players in The Waterboy ($190m). Both of those were eclipsed by his parenthood comedy Big Daddy, which grossed $228m the following year and still doesn't have the distinction of being his biggest hit – that would be Grown Ups ($272m), unless you count his voice work on the animated Hotel Transylvania ($359m).</p><p>The comic's pulling power has never been in doubt. But with Punch-Drunk Love, cast opposite the Oscar-nominated British actor Emily Watson, Sandler's acting skills were put to the test in some demented moments of warped romance. In one scene, the tentative lovers are exchanging whispered sweet nothings. Him: \"Your face is so beautiful, I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it.\" Her: \"I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful eyes with an ice-cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em.\"</p><p>The writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, who later made There Will Be Blood, felt rejuvenated by Sandler. \"I tried to make this simple little movie,\" he said. \"But sometimes simplicity can be so complicated. That's why it was good for Emily and me to work with Adam. He's so natural, he just shows up ready for work, whereas Emily and I tend to crawl up our own asses!</p><p>\"It's all about learning that whatever you did the first time was probably right. You don't have to do everything 50 times and then twist a corkscrew around it just to be sure.\"</p><p>Sandler's career didn't take a turn for the avant-garde after Anderson's movie but it's nice to think it let some fresh air into his persona, and allowed him to accept that he did not always have to be the guy with whom moviegoers would most like to share a pint.</p><p>Judd Apatow's 2008 Funny People, a study of the tormented personal lives of a group of fictional comedians, provided another example of how fine Sandler could be when he wasn't dispatching valentines to the audience. His character, an emotionally remote megastar, is diagnosed with a terminal illness but continues to use his celebrity for sex and power even after he recovers unexpectedly. Apatow and Sandler were room-mates early in their careers; it's possible that Funny People, with its radioactive anxiety about success, is the most personal film either man has made.</p><p>After every extracurricular challenge in other people's films, Sandler always snaps back into place in his ordinary Joe, blue-collar civvies. But the influence of Funny People was discernible in the part he wrote for himself in Grown Ups, where he played Lenny, a powerful agent concerned about the wedge that wealth had driven between him and his old school chums.</p><p>Lenny is careful to remove his snazzy sunglasses in front of his pals, and tries to conceal the fact that the young Asian woman in his party is in fact his children's au pair. In the climax, Lenny forgoes a sporting victory to allow a more downtrodden man a taste of triumph, which feels like Sandler's way of reassuring us that his own feet remain on the ground, even if that ground happens to be in Bel Air.</p><p>His ordinariness is the defining characteristic of his celebrity. Few modern stars have acquired such wealth and fame from pledging allegiance to the schlubby American everyman: sweatpants, corn dogs and all.</p><p>\"I don't feel he's changed,\" says Dugan. \"He's always been a really good guy. The press aren't nice to him – the reviews are crazy-cruel. But he doesn't care. All he wants to do is make people laugh and connect with the audience. He produces, he writes, he picks the music, he's in the editing room. He's a real film-maker – he's an artist.\"</p><p>Potted profile</p><p><strong>Born</strong> 9 September 1966, Brooklyn, New York City.</p><p><strong>Career</strong> After working the standup circuit, he landed a small acting role on The Cosby Show. In 1990, began a four-year stint on Saturday Night Live, launchpad for comedy superstars such as Tina Fey, Bill Murray, Kristen Wiig and Eddie Murphy.</p><p><strong>High point</strong> For him, the global success of Grown Ups. For the rest of us, his engagingly murky turns in Punch-Drunk Love and Funny People.</p><p><strong>Low point</strong> For a star whose worth is measured in box-office receipts, it must have mattered that his 2012 film That's My Boy flopped.</p><p><strong>What he says </strong>\"I know what [the critics] are writing about me. But then remember that I didn't get into movies to please the critics. I got into it to make people laugh and have fun with my friends.\" (2013)</p><p><strong>What they say </strong>\"What drives him is the desire to be funny and innovative.

Early next month 20th Century Fox's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2357291/\" title=\"\"><em>Rio 2</em></a>, in which a lovable blue parrot and his friends battle extinction, is being rolled out in conjunction with a campaign by the <a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/\" title=\"\">US Forest Service</a> to encourage children to spend more time outdoors and reconnect with nature.</p><p>Studio-sponsored, public-service announcements are planned in the hope of instilling a love for nature in children and creating a legacy of environmental stewardship.</p><p>The service says that more than 245 million Americans live within 100 miles of a national forest or grassland, yet people aren't taking advantage of these natural spaces. An app, <a href=\"http://www.discovertheforest.org/\" title=\"\">discovertheforest.org</a>, helps parents and children find the open spaces that 88% of children say they enjoy, according to one study.</p><p>Later this year Rihanna will be the voice of a character from DreamWorks' 3D computer-animated buddy comedy <em>Home</em>, based on the book <em>The True Meaning of Smekday</em>. The movie tells the story of an invasion of aliens and the relocation of humans to reservation land in Arizona. The comparison between Native Americans and the arrival of white settlers is more than just implied – a Navajo named Frank is depicted as the sole voice of reason.</p><p>But the insertion of environmental and multicultural messaging into animated films has less to do with Hollywood preaching than the execution of good business practice. The audience for animated film is broad, far broader than action adventure, and since James Cameron's eco-laden <em>Avatar</em> (still the highest grossing film of all time) and the superb Pixar hit <em>Wall-E</em> that addressed consumerism, environmental issues and the immense impact humans are having on this planet, film-makers have been comfortable addressing social issues they might shun in other genres.</p><p>\"It's not necessarily new,\" says Deadline Hollywood's Dominic Patten, pointing to the success of last year's <em>Epic</em>, from Fox, and DreamWorks' <em>The Croods</em>, both of which had strong environmental themes.</p><p>\"This has been true of animated films for many, many years,\" says Patten, though people often fail to grasp several important facts about animated film. \"They're not for kids any more – parents and children only make up 50% of the box office. In fact, <em>The Simpsons</em> introduced the idea of social and satirical complexity years ago, and that's part of what we're now seeing in film.\"</p><p>Animated films, he says, also tend to make boatloads of money. <em>Frozen</em> not only made a billion dollars but its soundtrack sat at No 1 for weeks. Last week Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed  that <em>Frozen</em> would surpass the $1.06bn box-office takings of <em>Toy Story 3</em>.</p><p>Third, he says animated films are the only globalised cinematic genre and have a vast reach across many markets. But it's not about getting on a soapbox. \"It's about talking about issues we know are important to people out there, as well as issues that are part of our world. If we find a way to tell more universally themed stories, film-makers can connect with audiences in stronger ways. That's what animated film can do: tell good, strong stories to everyone.\"</p><p><em>The Simpsons</em> creator Matt Groening, arguably father of the genre, now sponsors a chair at UCLA's School of Theatre, Film and Television that gives out awards and financing to animators who highlight social responsibility in their submissions.</p><p>\"It has to do with recognising the power of the moving image in the 21st century,\" says Barbara Boyle, associate dean of the school. \"Animators have been including social responsibility for decades. Now they're getting to be more important. Animators can do anything. They're not limited. It's a true art form. You can have animals speak. You have no boundaries to reality so it allows boundless creativity. If you're learning about human issues, it doesn't matter if it's a rabbit talking to you …\"</p>","headline":"Animated 'message' movies strike box-office gold","trailText":"After the runaway success
