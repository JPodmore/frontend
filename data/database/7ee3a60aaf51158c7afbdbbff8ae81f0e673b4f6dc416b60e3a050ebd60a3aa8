Faisal’s intervention is the clearest example so far. With previous kidnappings some Isis-supporting scholars have made the case that they could be spies but, according to reports, Isis’s own sharia court has cleared the aid worker of any such charge.</p> <p>In the 2 min 40 sec video the Jamaican preacher, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/24/race.world\" title=\"\">who was jailed in 2003</a>, says: “This is a message to my brothers in the Islamic State. It is well known to the world that you have a hostage by the name of Alan Henning and that his life is in jeopardy.</p> <p>“I’ve spoken to many people about Alan Henning and everyone spoke well about him. He loves people. He’s a good Samaritan. He’s a philanthropist. He is a sympathiser to Muslims.”</p> <p>Sitting behind a desk with the Qur’an in his hands, Faisal continues: “So to kill someone like that, an aid worker, is un-Islamic&nbsp;… the sharia law doesn’t allow you to kill someone like Alan Henning.</p> <p>“Because Alan Henning is not antagonistic towards Muslims, it is un-Islamic to kill such a person&nbsp;… Therefore I plead, I beg of you in the name of God to set this good Samaritan free.”</p> <p>The video came after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/wife-isis-alan-henning-release-islamic-state\" title=\"\">Henning’s wife pleaded on Tuesday</a> for her husband to be released.</p> <p>Henning, 47 was kidnapped by Isis militants in Syria in 2012 when his aid convey was stopped by masked gunmen and he was forcibly separated from his party.</p> <p>“I have seen Muslims across the globe question Islamic State over Alan’s fate,” Barbara Henning said in a statement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-87964392-116d-403d-959d-125c41bfc9c5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/24/1411554442256/e53ad63e-f201-4996-bf11-b08a17eb2492-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alan Henning, who is being held hostage by Islamic State militants.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Henning, who is being held hostage by Islamic State militants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family Handout/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan’s imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life.”</p> <p>Barbara Henning said she had been told that her husband had been found innocent of being a spy by a sharia court. “I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system. Please release Alan.”</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/08/radical-preachers-isis-islamic-state-online-conference\" title=\"\">the Guardian recorded a live online talk</a> in which Faisal condemned others for not supporting Isis. During his 45-minute talk delivered from Jamaica, Faisal was heard saying: “Instead of embracing the Islamic State, supporting the Islamic State and doing everything humanly possible for the success of the state … all they do is slander the mujahideen,” he said.</p> <p>The scholar, who has a reputation for describing many Muslim groups as heretics who should be condemned to death, recently tweeted that Isis was a punishment from Allah for “all fake Muslims who don’t want Islam”.</p> <p>He has described women captured by Isis militants during the conflict as the “spoils of war”.</p> <p>Towards the end of the video, which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, Faisal warns Isis of the consequences of killing Henning: “Killing him has no blessing, it will backfire on the Islamic State in a very bad way, the damage will not be able to be repaired.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNKt1UqDPL4\"

Islamic preacher who spent four years in a UK jail for soliciting murder and hate speech has made a video plea for Islamic State (Isis) to spare the life of British hostage Alan Henning.</p> <p>Abdullah el-Faisal, who is said to have played a part in radicalising the shoe bomber Richard Reid and the 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, is one the most radical English-speaking preachers to publicly call for Henning’s release.</p> <p>The one-time imam of south London’s Brixton mosque has been a fervent online champion of Isis, even supporting the kidnapping and rape of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/who-yazidi-isis-iraq-religion-ethnicity-mountains\" title=\"\">Yazidi minority women</a> in Iraq.</p> <p>In the video released on Wednesday morning, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNKt1UqDPL4\" title=\"\">Faisal begged for Henning’s life</a> and said that to kill him would be against Islamic law.</p> <p>There are growing signs that the kidnap of Henning is controversial even among Islamic extremists who have been sympathetic to Isis’s tactics. Faisal’s intervention is the clearest example so far. With previous kidnappings some Isis-supporting scholars have made the case that they could be spies but, according to reports, Isis’s own sharia court has cleared the aid worker of any such charge.</p> <p>In the 2 min 40 sec video the Jamaican preacher, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/24/race.world\" title=\"\">who was jailed in 2003</a>, says: “This is a message to my brothers in the Islamic State. It is well known to the world that you have a hostage by the name of Alan Henning and that his life is in jeopardy.</p> <p>“I’ve spoken to many people about Alan Henning and everyone spoke well about him. He loves people. He’s a good Samaritan. He’s a philanthropist. He is a sympathiser to Muslims.”</p> <p>Sitting behind a desk with the Qur’an in his hands, Faisal continues: “So to kill someone like that, an aid worker, is un-Islamic&nbsp;… the sharia law doesn’t allow you to kill someone like Alan Henning.</p> <p>“Because Alan Henning is not antagonistic towards Muslims, it is un-Islamic to kill such a person&nbsp;… Therefore I plead, I beg of you in the name of God to set this good Samaritan free.”</p> <p>The video came after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/wife-isis-alan-henning-release-islamic-state\" title=\"\">Henning’s wife pleaded on Tuesday</a> for her husband to be released.</p> <p>Henning, 47 was kidnapped by Isis militants in Syria in 2012 when his aid convey was stopped by masked gunmen and he was forcibly separated from his party.</p> <p>“I have seen Muslims across the globe question Islamic State over Alan’s fate,” Barbara Henning said in a statement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-87964392-116d-403d-959d-125c41bfc9c5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/24/1411554442256/e53ad63e-f201-4996-bf11-b08a17eb2492-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alan Henning, who is being held hostage by Islamic State militants.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Henning, who is being held hostage by Islamic State militants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family Handout/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan’s imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life.”</p> <p>Barbara Henning said she had been told that her husband had been found innocent of being a spy by a sharia court. “I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system. Please release Alan.”</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/08/radical-preachers-isis-islamic-state-online-conference\" title=\"\">the Guardian recorded a live online talk</a> in which Faisal condemned others for not supporting Isis. During his 45-minute talk delivered from Jamaica, Faisal was heard saying: “Instead of embracing the Islamic State, supporting the Islamic State and doing everything humanly possible for the success of the state … all they do is slander the mujahideen,” he said.</p> <p>The scholar, who has a reputation for describing many Muslim groups as heretics who should be condemned to death, recently tweeted that Isis was a punishment from Allah for “all fake Muslims who don’t want Islam”.</p> <p>He has described women captured by Isis militants during the conflict as the “spoils of war”.</p> <p>Towards the end of the video, which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, Faisal warns Isis of the consequences of killing Henning: “Killing him has no blessing, it will backfire on the Islamic State in a very bad way, the damage will not be able to be repaired.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNKt1UqDPL4\"

He was working with Muslims to help the most vulnerable within Syria. Nothing has changed. He went to Syria to help his Muslim friends deliver much-needed aid.</p> <p>“We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan’s imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life.”</p> <p>Barbara Henning said she had been told that her husband had been found innocent of being a spy by a sharia court. “I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system. Please release Alan,” she added.</p> <p>Earlier, Henning’s brother-in-law said he feared the militants could move Alan after the US launched its first air strikes in Syria aimed at Isis strongholds.</p> <p>Colin Livesey said he feared Henning’s whereabouts would be unknown once more if he was moved. “I don’t want to lose the faith in knowing he’s coming home,” he told ITV News.</p> <p>One of the areas targeted by US was Raqqa – an Isis stronghold where Henning is believed to be held.</p> <p>Livesey described his brother-in-law as an “amazing bloke … a genuine, down-to-earth guy” who was a loving husband and father to his two children.</p> <p>“He thought he was doing the right thing by going up there and helping other people in another country, to give them aid, because that’s the sort of guy he is … he doesn’t deserve what’s happening to him now,” he said.</p> <p>“He’s so passionate about what he does and that makes us so proud of him. To do it at Christmas, to miss his own family Christmas to go to Syria, speaks volumes of what a man he is.”</p> <p>David Cameron, who is in New York attending the annual UN gathering of world leaders, has backed the air strikes. They were ordered by the US president, Barack Obama, after intelligence reports indicated that an attack by an organisation linked to al-Qaida called the Khorasan group was “imminent”.</p>","headline":"Wife of Isis hostage Alan Henning makes plea for his release","trailText":"Barbara Henning receives recording of her husband pleading for his life after US attacks Islamic State strongholds in Syria","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/23/1411503321033/Alan-Henning-at-a-refugee-004.jpg","wordcount":"425","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"447965616","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"5421d452e4b0233fd1642759","internalOctopusCode":"9560494","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Chris Johnston","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-09-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2163452","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-09-26T20:16:08Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/wife-isis-alan-henning-release-islamic-state","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/23/wife-isis-alan-henning-release-islamic-state","tags":[{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State (Isis)","description":"The latest news and comment on the Islamic State (Isis) militant group","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/isis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/isis","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/us-military","webTitle":"US military","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-military","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-military","references":[]},{"id":"world/usa","webTitle":"United States","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/usa","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

To do it at Christmas, to miss his own family Christmas to go to Syria, speaks volumes of what a man he is.”</p> <p>David Cameron, who is in New York attending the United Nations’ annual gathering of world leaders, has backed the air strikes. They were ordered by the US president, Barack Obama, after intelligence reports indicated that an attack by an organisation linked to al-Qaida called the Khorasan group was “imminent”.</p> <p>The prime minister is using the two-day meeting to muster support for international action against Isis and to discuss Britain’s contribution to the US-led coalition. Cameron is also expected to speak with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani – the first meeting between a British prime minister and a leader of Iran since the revolution of 1979 – in an attempt to enlist Tehran’s support.</p> <p>Obama has said the US will “do what’s necessary” to tackle the militants. Support for the campaign by five Arab states – Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates – underlined the support he was building for international action against Isis, the president said.</p>","headline":"Fears for Isis hostage Alan Henning after US air strikes in Syria","trailText":"Brother-in-law of kidnapped British aid volunteer expresses concern that action could prompt Isis to make his whereabouts unknown","newspaperPageNumber":"6","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/23/1411497451258/328a04f0-f439-4dee-97f2-b91686e22c67-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"366","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"447959026","allowUgc":"false","internalComposerCode":"5421bd3ee4b04f6eaabcaf3b","internalOctopusCode":"9560066","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Chris Johnston","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-09-24T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2163422","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-09-26T18:38:27Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/fears-isis-hostage-alan-henning-us-air-strikes-syria","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/23/fears-isis-hostage-alan-henning-us-air-strikes-syria","tags":[{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State (Isis)","description":"The latest news and comment on the Islamic State (Isis) militant group","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/isis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/isis","references":[]},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria","description":"Latest news from Syria as covered by the Guardian.

It then depicts Haines' murder by beheading.</p><p>The killer's voice and his distinctive London accent suggest that he is the man who was previously responsible for the video-taped murders of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. At the end of the two-and-a-half minute film, the killer is shown holding a distraught Henning by the collar of the orange jumpsuit in which he is dressed. Indicating towards his captive with his knife, the killer says: \"If you, Cameron, persist in fighting the Islamic State, then you, like your master Obama, will have the blood of your people on your hands.\"</p><p>His abduction is said to have distressed members of the group of amateur aid workers who organised the convoy, and angered some members of the Muslim communities in which they live, with accusations that a non-Muslim should never have been allowed to join the mission because of the risk. It was his second trip to Syria – a first visit nine months earlier had been trouble-free.</p><p>Henning was among a group of volunteers who raised money to purchase medical equipment, including defibrillators, stethoscopes and oxygen, and former NHS ambulances, for a hospital at Idlib, in north-west Syria.</p><p>After helping to raise the funds, he is said to have insisted on joining the convoy rather than spend Christmas with his wife and two teenage children at their home in Eccles, Greater Manchester.</p><p>One of the organisers, Kasim Jameel, a taxi driver from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said \"Alan is a man who is full of compassion and we are just praying to Allah that he is released safe and sound.</p><p>\"We are liaising with the authorities and we do not want to say anything which might put him in any further jeopardy or which will inflame the situation. I could tell a lot of stories about the good that Alan has done and about how, as a non Muslim, he has helped Muslims who have suffered in the conflict.</p><p>\"He is motivated to help others – not just by helping the convoy but by loads of other things as well.</p><p>\"He is the nicest of nice guys who has done so much to help other people. He is just a normal bloke, an everyday taxi driver who wanted to do good. We are thinking about him all the time and praying that he will be allowed home to his family.\"</p><p>The convoy set off from Bolton on 20 December, last year, with Jameel, <a href=\"http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/10895378.Convoy_in_mercy_trip_to_war_torn_Syria/\" title=\"\">telling his local newspaper</a>, the Bolton News, that they had been inspired by the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/20/abbas-khan-death-syria-family\" title=\"\">Abbas Khan</a>, an orthopaedic surgeon from London, who died in Syrian government custody earlier that year.</p><p>It was the second convoy organised by the same group: the previous March its members joined a group of Muslims from Scotland to take seven ambulances, medical equipment and baby milk to Idlib.</p><p>A BBC journalist who met Henning while making a documentary about aid convoys to Syria described him as a likeable and amusing man.</p><p>Catrin Nye said he told her that he had been deeply moved by his first trip to Syria. \"It had been a life changing experience,\" she said. \"He had handed out the goods. He described holding the children ... and how that really affected him. He told me he had to go back.\"</p><p>This year, however, British Muslims carrying aid to Syria have fallen under some suspicion, and the UK government is warning against travel to the country under any circumstances.</p><p>Jameel has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28104499\" title=\"\">been advised</a> by police at Dover, Kent, against travelling to Syria, while the Charity Commission has warned that material carried by aid convoys may be abused for non-charitable purposes.

Obviously, if we knew where he was, we would be able to look at all sorts of options but we don't know where he is.</p><p>\"We have considered every possible option to support these kidnap victims – both British and others – and if we knew where they were, it would be a different story.\"</p><p>Hammond said officials had explained to Henning's family the limited options open to the UK government, whose policy is not to pay ransoms: \"They understand, because we have explained to them in detail, the limitations of our abilities. We are dealing with a very barbaric organisation whose values are completely different from ours.\"</p><p>Analysts said the admission by Hammond may also mean that intelligence services do not know the location of the masked man with a British accent who has fronted the videos showing the beheading of two American journalists and of British aid worker David Haines, which was released on Saturday.</p><p>On Monday, Haines's teenage daughter, Bethany, posted a Facebook message saying she had been touched by the support she had received. She wrote: \"Hi, I'm David's daughter who lives in Perth I was really touched by the messages of support during this hard time I know my dad would be really touched and grateful.\"</p><p>Michael Scheuer, whose service with the CIA saw him lead its Osama bin Laden unit and serve with its directorate of intelligence  and directorate of operations, said the British-speaking militant responsible for Haines's death was likely to be close to the hostages.</p><p>Scheuer said: \"If they are going to use him as a prop, if the hostages are still alive, he probably will be close by for when they next want to kill somebody. My guess is they don't know where 'Jihadi John' is, or the other hostage takers.\"</p><p>British officials have said they were making progress on identifying the masked militant with the London accent seen in the last three videos.</p><p>The hunt to locate Henning, and to track down his captors, is being led by the UK's foreign intelligence service, MI6, with GCHQ, the UK's centre for eavesdropping on electronic communications, assisting. Western human intelligence assets on the ground near Raqqa in Syria, where the hostages may be being held, are sparse.</p><p>A previous US attempt to rescue hostages led to a raid which failed to locate the captives. It came about from details provided by hostages whom Isis had released after ransoms were paid, and this fact became public.</p><p>Ben Barry, senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said: \"Hostage rescue, deep in enemy-held territory, is very difficult. This is needle in a haystack stuff.\"</p><p>Scheuer said the Isis hostage takers had proved themselves to be disciplined in not providing electronic clues that US and UK intelligence could use to identify where the captives are being held.</p><p>In the UK, counter-terrorism investigators are trying to locate associates of the militant with the British accent, and Scheuer believes they are likely to know his identity. But, Scheuer pointed out that in recent times those behind public beheadings have rarely been captured and brought to justice.</p>","headline":"MI6 does not know where Isis hostage Alan Henning is held, says UK","trailText":"Defence secretary says officials have spoken in depth to the family of 47-year-old, whom group has threatened  to murder","newspaperPageNumber":"13","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"The Guardian","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/15/1410807322449/Alan-Henning-004.jpg","wordcount":"583","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"447252588","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"9525254","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Vikram Dodd","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-09-16T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2158918","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-09-18T19:05:51Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/15/mi6-isis-hostage-alan-henning-uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/15/mi6-isis-hostage-alan-henning-uk","tags":[{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State (Isis)","description":"The latest news and comment on the Islamic State (Isis) militant group","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/isis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/isis","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"world/iraq","webTitle":"Iraq","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/iraq","references":[]},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/middleeast","references":[]},{"id":"politics/philip-hammond","webTitle":"Philip Hammond","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/philip-hammond","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/philip-hammond","references":[]},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/politics","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/vikramdodd","webTitle":"Vikram Dodd","rcsId":"GNL004781","r2ContributorId":"16558","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/vikram_dodd_140x140.jpg","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Vikram Dodd is a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime\">crime correspondent</a></p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/vikramdodd","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/vikramdodd","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/topstories","webTitle":"Top stories","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/topstories","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/topstories","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-447252933","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/15/1410807322449/Alan-Henning-004.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","source":"AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Alan Henning","suppliersReference":"DV1866970","height":"84","credit":"AFP/Getty Images","caption":"Alan Henning's family have been told that the options open to the UK government, whose policy is not to pay ransoms, are limited.
